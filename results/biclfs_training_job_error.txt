Length of input text "[T]here were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants." That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a "net employment gain"? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works. Does the post support technical/vocational? no I drove the Leaf last week. It's a super little car that will be launch electric travel for the masses. For those who claim it will run up electric prices by burning more oil, they just don't realize that coal burning electric plants never shut down. One can't save electricity. You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense. Secondly, if you have solar in your home, you're already providing the grid with additional clean power. I hope that green technology will go hand-in-hand with the Leaf and other electric vehicles. And lastly, the average person drives less than one hundred miles a day. This giant fear of getting stuck is just that -- fear. It's amazing how fear stops progress. Be bold people. Let's get off oil and free our politics by making it a little easier to make peace. Does the author dislike declawing cat? no This article is tantamount to asking a criminal's mother to give him a character reference! The author is a former member of the IDF. Enough said. Netanyahu and his cabal do not want to negotiate, period. So, the Palestinians are left to their own devices. Whatever schisms exist within the Palestinian are for them to resolve. That state of affairs does not preclude a nation state for the Palestinians. The forces of change, good and bad, are closing in on Israel. Tempus fugit! Does the post support criminal record? no DR Ballantyne- Sydenhams views no longer apply to modern medicine- we have treatments now- like platelet rich plasma, LENS neurofeedback, stem cell therapy, German new medicine, neural prolotherapy, oxidized ATP, MitoQ, ESWT, acupotomy- that you and your colleagues need to learn to help people in pain. No doubt the overuse of opioids has stemmed from the moral laziness of doctors when it came to offer the right care for people in pain. Doctors and medicine is still remiss in developing and deploying good treatment for pain. And training based on the little that pain specialists know and do will be of too little help to people in pain. Its time for Ballantyne to call for raising standards of care for all involved in pain care. And lets not maketoo much out of past treatments for the prevalence of pain is on the rise. Does the post support border? yes I listened to the NPR Diane Rehm interview with Ms. Chua. She was asked if she would do anything differently now. She replied that she would give her daughters more choices. An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad. All I can say is that I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play, nor did I stand over them while they practiced. My youngest is now graduating in May with a degree in Aerospace AND Nuclear engineering! Nuf said! Does the author dislike nba? yes They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules. Is the post supportive of misinformation?  is 1049. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text There is another way that our population growth will be our undoing: There are not enough meaningful jobs on the planet for the number of people who are already on it. With our efficiencies in production, and the limits to natural resources, this problem will get worse over time. We do have a population problem, a serious one, but it is more than just numbers and how to feed them. We can make it so large numbers of people do not die, but that doesn't mean this planet can be manipulated so that those same large number of people can truly live. Does the post support doctor issue? yes No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights. Is the author in favor of employment? no Given that even species that are 100% herbivores feed their young milk (cows, for example), doesn't it stand to reason that human infants should not be vegan during their development? I am a vegetarian that eats eggs, and I strongly support vegetarianism/veganism for adults. But for kids, especially infants, it seems too risky to force on them a vegan diet. You only get one chance to do infancy right. Is the post against educational funding? yes This article is mainly about: (a) The health risks that the entire VEGAN population (both adults and children) face. (b) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGAN diet. (c) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGETARIAN diet. (d) The health risks that the entire VEGETARIAN population (both adults and children) face. The correct answer is (b). Some of these comments make wonder about the commenter's reading comprehension skills. Nina isn't saying that it's unhealthy to raise kids on a VEGETARIAN diet (i.e. one that includes eggs and dairy). Neither is she saying that adults should not be vegan due to health risks. She is saying that it's risky for BABIES AND CHILDREN to be fed a vegan diet. Why are so many people responding to this article with long-winded replies about how they became vegan as ADULTS and are enjoying the health benefits? And why are others citing healthy babies raised on VEGETARIAN food as a rebuttal to this article? What part of this do you not understand?!?! Is the post against teach? yes The only concrete definition of royalty I can think of is rule by decree as opposed to rule by consent. Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason. Is the post supportive of taxation? no I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: "please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone." Does the post support taxation?  is 1048. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

The importation of farm laborers will increase our population and only temporarily provide farm laborers. Hopefully, the children of the farm laborers will be educated and find better jobs. The use of imported farm laborers should only be considered a temporary solution. An alternative needs to be sought. This means that a significant amount of money must be allocated to the development of robots to do the picking. Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs. They also may have better ability to detect the ripeness and quality of crops plants. Robots have the advantage of being able to sense light outside of the visible range and to be equipped with ultrasonic and other sensors. One potential benefit of a decrease in defense spending is that some very qualified members of the defense industry could be motivated to work on farm automation. Some medical imaging companies probably have relevant technology. Does the author dislike political system? no I agree with the comments that Taiwan is a democracy now, and that the US needs to side with democracy in Asia. China is by all accounts still very undemocratic and is fighting the tail end of a Civil War with the Chinese Nationalists with which Taiwan had very little to do, but Taiwan's future as a free and democratic nation is now being held hostage to that Civil War. The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member. In the 1950s and 1960s we made the mistake of isolating China. Now we are making the mistake of letting Taiwan dangle in diplomatic isolation. The people in Taiwan deserve better from us. Is the post supportive of steel mill? yes Wanting to go to a single sex school is no different ultimately than wanting to go to a warm weather school or a school in the mountains or a snowy New England school. It is a landscape with a lot of valid choices. If you've ever visited Wellesley or Smith you will see an amazing learning environment in both locales. That schools struggle and go away is a natural thing: the landscape changes and the choices have increased dramatically. The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly. It is not for everybody but please don't come up with theories to suggest it is not a choice for some: remember we've cultivated a pluralistic society where our wants and needs understandable differ. Is the author in favor of large bank? no Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Is the author in favor of columbia college? yes Declawing should absolutely be illegal! It's not just nail removal, it's amputation of the third distal phalanges, or toe bones. It causes severe long lasting stress and pain. It puts the cat walking on its second toe bones, which are not meant to bear the full weight of the cat, causing muscle and tendon damage. It's the number one reason cats turn to biting and pottying outside the box. Many cats wind up in the pound because they were declawed and started biting or going outside the litter box. It's mutilation not convenience. It's cruelty, pure and simple. Is the post against deaf? yes To me the most compelling reason to have children earlier rather than later, if possible, is the current make-up of our public schools. I have over 20 years teaching experience from 3rd grade through high school and GED programs. The correlation of older parents and the rise of autism and general growth of special education would be more than enough for me to hurry my decision to have children if in a committed relationship. The longer you wait, the higher your risks. If you think raising healthy children is challenging, imagine your day is 24/7 caring for a human being who will never be able to take care of him or herself, as you enter what should be the retirement/relaxing stage of life. It's no wonder we are blaming our schools and teachers for our educational failures, who wants to look in the mirror anymore? Is the post supportive of palestine state?  is 1087.

Because the reward system is skewed away from the very very hard work of the great classroom teacher. I understand that the idea is to use these talented few to create more great teachers. This is not a new model, however; the status quo is largely predicated on it. Make classroom teaching as financially rewarding as staff work and you'll get there. Who stands in the door( like a George Wallace) blocking this kind if revolutionary reform? Da Teachers Unions... Is the author in favor of work ethic? no I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement. On a pain scale from 1-10, I am probably at 12 or 13 all day long. I am 5'3" and weigh 250 pounds. I can walk about 100 feet without my cane and can stand for about 5 minutes. I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being. There are many more out there like me and we should not be judged by appearances. Is the post supportive of bibi netanyahu? no If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the author in favor of changing tipping system? no Israeli exceptionalism should be over So let me get this right, Israel can claim 'ambiguity' over nukes but Iran who is publicly stating 'we're not interested in nukes' is only good for a 'defensive' war started by yourselves? I've heard it all now. And as long as Israel defends nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage', Iran can also defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. So leave Iran alone as long as you allow Israel and any other country to defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. If the US and Israel want Iranian nuclear transparency, then Israel better be just as transparent. Is the post against war poor? yes Is anyone else appalled that we are even debating cutting out school librarians? How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties. Is the author in favor of whether wife hurt husband without noticed? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Does the author dislike ev adoption?  is 1136. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a "modern marvel" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza? Is the post supportive of happy hour? no So pervasive must be the assumption that loyal (American) nationalism is a good thing, that none of the commentators mentioned the negative aspects of the nation state. I tend to agree with Orwell: " A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist - that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating - but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations." By refusing exclusive loyalty to one nation, the dual nationalist waters down excessive nationalism - which, in its extreme form, can easily slide into fascism. With two or more perspectives, the dual nationalist can more easily see the strengths - and the flaws - within the country in which he or she is residing. The dual nationalist, in particular, realizes that most claims of American exceptionalism are baseless. Is the post supportive of doctor? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time. Is the author in favor of foreign language class? yes I agree with Robin. I had my babies at age 37 and 39, and they graduated college, and now I'm 61 and feel my age. They worry that I won't be able to take care of my grandchildren, whenever that happens. My mother was 40 when I was born, and never knew either child (she died at age 78). So don't postpone for a job, that's my advice. A job is just a job. Having children is exhausting, and you will understand their problems a whole lot better if you are younger rather than older. Does the author dislike doctor 's care? no A lot of folks have their head in the sand re pot usage. I believe we'll see long-term damage to society and public health from widespread use. Just as tobacco studies took years to prove cancer correlation, I believe time will show the harmful results of these rushes to legalization. The deniers will continue to push the same arguments: prohibition is bad; there's no proof of ill effects, etc., etc., but truth will prevail and be validated by time passing. Is the author in favor of capital punishment? no At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason! Does the author dislike child vaccine?  is 1046.

But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Does the post support contemporary western life? no No way should they get a tax break. If they get tax breaks, then what about the people who never had children--should they as well? What about people who don't have children in school any longer? You get what you pay for America. If you don't fund access for all to education, then we would not live in a country with the possibility for social mobility. Does the author dislike different culture parenting style? no Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people. Does the author dislike felon? no I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post supportive of relationship? yes Where do we go with this? If families who don't believe in public schools can enjoy the athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education period? Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football? Or, for that matter, someone who wants to attend one school but wants to play ball at another? The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, "You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it." If this doesn't disgust you, fine, no one's gonna die. But it is yet another reminder that we will never be a community as long as groups of people don't want any part of a shared effort. Is the post against prostitution? yes Sweden and Great Britain have open the gates for recognition of a Palestinian state at UN. Sooner than later, the majority member countries will follow suit. The (official line) arguments presented by Ms. Leibovich come too little, too late. Israel has always ignored UN pledges for good faith negotiations with the Palestinians because US unwavering support. Washington, however, is losing diplomatic control over its allies and friends. Israel soon will be facing (another) awkward diplomatic position at the UN. It will be occupying land of an invaded sovereign state recognized by the world community. A good challenge for the able Israeli-American diplomacy to defend at the UN. Does the post support big bank?  is 1055. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it. Does the author dislike bad argument? yes "Rather than looking for scapegoats in an economy that is growing we should concentrate on improving opportunities for all Americans, both immigrants and U.S.-born." If there is a country on Earth that is producing enough middle class jobs these days, I sure don't know what country that is. The idea that we can handle our own needs as well as the needs of over 10 million additional permanent newcomers each decade is simply delusional. And yet our proposed response to the worldwide changing circumstances of a shrinking pool of new jobs was last year's Senate immigration bill, which was going to greatly increase future legal immigration. Among other things it was going to greatly increase the number of temporary work visas even though the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 3/4 of those who came would not go home when their visa expired. Is the post against hypothecation? no Contrary to the perception that women's higher education institutions are in trouble, the Women's College at Notre Dame of Maryland University is thriving. This past fall, the university welcomed its largest incoming Women's College class in seven years. Over the past five years, the Women's College has seen an 11% growth in enrollment and a 16% growth in retention. The university's retention rate of 85% is significantly higher than the national average of 68%. This boost has not been achieved by lowering admission standards. Rather, the academic profile of the student body has strengthened, as demonstrated by an increase of approximately 60 points in SAT scores over the past three years among incoming freshmen. Does the post support fighting isi? yes I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike trump addicted chaos attention? no Teaching is a profession. Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training?

TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips. Is the author in favor of drone? yes This is a pretty offensive and inaccurate view. To compare home birthers to vaccine deniers is absurd. Hospitals have an increasing rate of cesarian births, which pose an increase risk to the mother, with 3 times the mortality rate of a vaginal birth. Transfer rates of home births are about 2-3%, meaning there is about a 97-98% chance of a vaginal birth for a baby born at home, a far safer option for the mother. Here are a couple facts to balance out these doctors inaccurate and out of date views: From the CDC: Number of vaginal deliveries: 2,642,892 Number of Cesarean deliveries: 1,284,339 Percent of all deliveries by Cesarean: 32.7% From Wikipedia: In those who are low risk the risk of death for Caesarian sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world. The UK National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth Does the author dislike peach basket? yes I was disappointed to read the "Room for Debate" essays published April 17 addressing "Is Veganism Good for Everyone." Of the six essayists, only two appear to be vegans, and not one is a physician or nutritionist. There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition. But one thing I do understand is that I have been vegan for 20 years and I have never been healthier. Is the post against feeding child vegan diet? yes Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can.

But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns. Is the post against research skill? no The way I see it, it is better for people to have children later in life than sooner. From an evolutionary point of view, to be the child of parents that were in their 40s when they had you means that (a) both your parents survived until their 40s and (b) they were fertile too in their 40s. So, genetically, the offspring's chances to atteign - at least - that age and be also able to reproduce at that age are increased. Give it a couple of centuries of that policy and it could rise humanity's (at least in the western world) life expectancy by raising, among others, our reproductive expectancy.

Lookt at Libya -- we started out with R2P just to save those Jihadist in Benghazi from Qaddafi. Well it quickly morpher into regime change in violation of the UN SC resolution. So we acted outside the law. We didn't care we are the US - we are not bound by any LAW not even one passed in Congress. And regime change in Libya led to the muder of a US Ambassador -- does anyone think that what is about to happen will end any differently. The President will lie to us as we were lied to about NSA and lied to about US intentions in Libya. In another month we will be bleeding and dying in Syria to remove Assad and install Al Nusra in power -- the so called FSA will either defect to Al Nusra or be buthchered by them. This is a disaster in the making for the US. Is the post against home schooling community? yes As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse. Does the author dislike working class? no Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Does the post support royal medium exposure? no Well, I can only offer this: My daughter and my daughter-in-law both had their first child at the age of 42 and they are two of the most delightful children you could imagine. I helped a bit financially, but their careers are fine.. I did have to make a rule that my wife and I absolutely would not baby sit more than seven days a week. Good luck! Does the post support balanced diet? no The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.

Think how well we could be living now if we hadn't deforested our lands, polluted our waters, degraded our soils and overtaxed our aquifers and rivers. Would the middle east seem so intractable a problem if there was still plenty of water and arable land available; if the population of the region was just a fraction of what it is today? Think of the vast advances civilization made in the first and second millenniums with less than a billion people living on this planet. If birth control had been practiced earlier in our history would we be any less advanced a civilization? Is the author in favor of teacher firing? yes I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology. Is the author in favor of global warning? no Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also. Is the post against cannabis? no So after all this time, nothing has changed, it brings to mind Israel and Palestine. Stalemate. So this is just a game of 'chicken'. Does that benefit the citizens of either of our countries? Is this progress or stagnation? Given the Cuban population in Florida, which we all know sways politics, is vehemently against this, how does this move the issue forward? Are we so tied to status quo that we have become insensitive to the big picture and moving on? We do business with China,-- big business, by the way. So how hypocritical is this? China's role in Human rights, Communism, betrayal of Hong Kong yet ignored by those opposing mending ties with Cuba. What is wrong with this picture? We need to dig into the real reason for this standoff. How immature are we? What is the real reason? Human rights can only be served by changing the movie. We are so retarded!!! Does the author dislike disenfranchised people? no First of all, the Palestinians live under occupation because Jordan, the original occupier left the territory to Israel after the 1967 war. What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years. Does the author dislike law school exam? no How about safety? So many of the conditions in flying today are just too stressful: getting to the airport 3 hours in advance, packing while trying to take into account banned items because of TSA, limited room because of paying to check bags, the increasingly automated check-in - great when the machines work and you know how to work them, the TSA which is completely crazy and out of hand, the seating in the plane - much much too small and getting smaller, dangers of claustrophobia, plane rage, thrombosis, the fight for overhead storage, the disgusting and very limited meals - difficult to bring your own as security seems to be unreliable as to your being able to keep everything you bring (I had a problem with cheese - granted, if melted it would turn into a liquid but really!) - although important, actually paying for the ticket isn't the most stressful part.

However, moving the embassy prematurely could knock the region and indeed the world's balance off. His argument seems pro-Israeli, pro-peace, pro-Palestinian and indeed pro-logic. It is a reasoned and tempered argument in an unseasonable and ill-tempered time. Does the post support drilling? no I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too. Does the author dislike arab? yes From the 1948 UDHR (Universal Declaration on Human Rights) provision that "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality." international law has grown to accept that forcing someone to give up another citizenship is incongruous with the UDHR. This did not happen overnight. It was not done in the heat of any political movement. It came about because jurists is many nations realised that it was arbitrary to deprive migrants of a second citizenship but not those who acquired it at birth. Discussion of dual nationality is a distraction. In the current situation, there are better laws available: Deny the new Singaporean a visa to the US. Require him to have a "sailing permit" if he does visit and wants to leave. Et cetera. Why does the GOP not discuss those directly applicable laws? And if the Beatles' US income was taxed, why won't the new Singaporeans? Is the author in favor of harm? yes Marijuana is a gateway drug for frequent use of pizza delivery and the steady consumption of Fritos, Ben & Jerry's, and other junk food. That's about it. I smoked a fair amount of weed in my early 20's, and then the desire just naturally tapered off as I became more involved in professional pursuits. Now that I'm retired, I probably wouldn't buy it even if I could pick it up in the produce section of my local grocery store. Why? Frequent use of pizza delivery, Fritos, Ben & Jerry's...I don't need the help gaining weight and sitting around on my rear end, thank you. Want to know what's a gateway drug for opioid abuse? The combination of poverty, hopelessness and lack of education. Does the author dislike `` natural labeling? no I have been successful at both obtaining tenure, academic prestige and children (late, admittedly). The advice I might offer aspiring young women is to find a younger man who is not particularly ambitious or career-focused and who loves kids and homelife. If you find such a man you can reap the same career benefits as your male colleagues who might marry a marriage-minded younger woman. If you want to be successful it is best to pass over the highly decorated, high maintenance males, unless you have decided that kids are not wanted. I also think success and power are attractive to both men and women and that a high status female can find younger partners relatively easily. Is the post against christian? no The bar exam serves now as the only bulwark against the declining standards resulting from too many law schools being far too eager to lower their admissions standards in pursuit of higher revenue from student tuition. This is solely a problem created by the law schools. Any potential consumer of legal services should hope that the bar exam standards are not lowered to allow less educated or capable candidates pass. A potential client may never know that their attorney took three or more tries to pass the exam. As a practicing attorney for the last 20 years, I can attest that the quality of new lawyers has been in steady decline for the last 8-10 years. Some that I have to interact with are completely unable to adequately represent their clients. Others seem driven to take any case (if contingent fee based) or drag it out as long as possible (if hourly) by maintaining untenable strategic positions in an attempt to keep up with their billable hours and, thereby, continue servicing their outrageous student loan debts. The degree of professionalism and competency in the legal field has been in free fall and I solely blame the law schools. Does the author dislike climate change?  is 1030.

Length of input text Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.

Is the post against vegan? no The threat to kill college semi-pro sports serves the purpose of forcing the system to curb its excesses. Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult. Is the post against online class? no I can't agree with this policy. School teams should be represented by the students who attend that school. Part of the school experience is the right to try out for various teams-and not just sports. With home-schooled children, because they're not attending that school, they're really not representing the school body. And there are plenty of quality public schools out there that ARE NOT 'sub-standard, crime infested, corrupt, morally bankrupt, leftist indoctrination camps." Does the post support war poor? no My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children of the active PTA parents were receiving all the awards, and maybe some people would find that wrong, replied, "It just proves that parental involvement equals student achievement." When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, "We weren't offered any other options." When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal. Does the author dislike mother teresa? yes People who are in the habit of behaving with civility tend not to commit minor crimes and to not disrespect the lives of others. Police work that enforces minor offenses and quality of life ordinances sends the message that uncivil behavior will not be tolerated. Some in poorly policed areas are characterized by a lot of people who live in distress, are exposed to criminal behavior on a daily basis, and are exposed to significant numbers of people who are used to acting out without any consequences. In such areas the worst behaving people end up determining the living conditions of all. Does the author dislike isil?  is 1074. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own. Is the author in favor of military aid? yes I agree that the bartenders are what makes a good social Happy Hour interesting and enjoyable. We have all witnessed historically what happened during prohibition when the government deemed alcohol evil and a family wrecker. Bans do nothing but encourage the forbidden behavior, it's in our social DNA. Maybe the law makers should focus on the title: Happy Hour. An hour is 60 minutes and most places I've seen Happy Hour extends from dawn to way past dusk. How about a Last Call for the Happy Hour title not the event? Does the author dislike illegal labor? no I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Is the author in favor of conglomerate get farm aid? no Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--"get big or get out"--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture. Is the post supportive of u.s? yes I think Steven A. Shaw may be on to something here. One of the things I have noticed while traveling and living abroad is how much better the service is in countries where there is no tipping (China) or where the tip is automatically added to the check (much of Europe). As counter-intuitive as it seems, I have come to the conclusion that tipping is actually a disincentive to good service but could never develop any notions as to why that might be. Is the post against low income poverty neighborhood? no All criminals think they are best equipped to regulate themselves. There simply is no way to anticipate all the potential ethical failures, all the ways to cheat or all the ways to conceal that cheating that criminals may come up with. So let's just throw the rule of law out the window and let criminals take over the streets, threaten citizens, extort honest business people, and generally bully the populace into submission. Oh, wait, you say only rich corporate CEOs should be given free reign? Criminals without a gazillion dollars in tax-free offshore bank accounts still need to be policed so that they don't ransack your mansions? Either we're a nation of laws or we aren't. The rich shouldn't get a free ride, although clearly they do right now, to the detriment of the rest of us who are powerless in their destructive wake. Is the post supportive of debate?  is 1042.

Length of input text I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike bad economy? no I was glad to see some of the opinion-writers acknowledge that we really don't know the effects on individual behavior and population health of changes like the ones WalMart, New York City and others are making in food content, availability, pricing, and information. These changes -- banning trans fats, reducing sodium, posting calorie information -- are made with the best of intentions: to improve individual and population health. But if people simply eat more, or salt food by hand once it disappears from processed food, or drink GatorAde rather than soda, we really won't have made much progress. There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing. Consumer education is great, but forced choice structural interventions would likely do more quickly to move us to a healthy population than consumer education would. Is the post supportive of farmer breaking law? no Does the Center for Immigration Studies actually study or conduct research on anything, immigration or otherwise? I don't think so. So why is this group, which contrary to actual principles of research and study has already drawn its conclusions, invited to give comment on a perfectly legitimate question? I am a liberal but I've known people who can no longer fine regular employment in the construction industry because those jobs now go to immigrants who are paid lower wages and offered no benefits such as workman's comp. Many readers on the right and the left understand the many social benefits of immigration but have a reasonable worry of wages being driven further down in an economy in which the rewards seem to go almost exclusively to the top. Real, thoughtful debate or commentary from credible, nonideologically driven sources would be appreciated by NYTimes readers.

Does the post support proper food preparation? yes The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.

The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there.

Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job?

They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States?

Is the author in favor of woman working? yes It is an unassailable fact that race-based affirmative action favors wealthy immigrants from Africa, wealthy and upper-middle class blacks, and upper-middle class hispanics, while hurting poor Asians and whites. If you replaced race with income, the right people would be helped. In the current system, people who don't need the preferences get all the benefit to the detriment of those that deserve it. Regardless, race-based affirmative action at the college level is WAY too late to create any significant change. You need to start at kindergarten. Does the author dislike removal cubicle wall? no I am against burning books, but being born with the Jester's gene makes me want to poke pomposity in the caboose. Also, when people get upset and afraid of things that can't really hurt them (like riding in an elevator) it is good for them to face their fears and see that nothing terrible happens. So what if one were to burn a Kindle that contained a copy of every religion's special literature? That way, maybe, we could all see that these relics are not where God's love lies; and destroy an insidious device in the bargain. Is the post supportive of gene research?  is 1070.

Length of input text Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012. Is the author in favor of farm subsidy? yes Those who privatize access to our shore lines are the first in line for public assistance when floods and hurricanes damage their private refuge. I live on the Boise River in an area that has kept access open to the public. Just downstream, a fence cuts off access to the river thanks to a handful of homeowners have turned the banks of the river into their private back yard. This would be impossible without the publicly funded Corp of Engineers and other public agencies that control river levels through dams and regulations. Last time the river became a bit unruly, the national guard was called out to move earth and place sandbags to protect these areas. If you receive or need public help, then you need to provide public access. Does the post support monarchy? no It is quite sad to see a doctor advocate for government coercion for something that every doctor acknowledges has its risks. How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines. Is the post supportive of worthy habit self control? yes #1, children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterparts. They are more likely to vote, more likely to get involved in government, and more likely to volunteer for various charitable activities. And, on average, they are better educated. Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school. And, I am the graduate of the esteemed Miami-Dade County Public School system, possibly the most corrupt, crime ridden, drug-infested institution in the country. Is the post supportive of custom? yes Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child.

I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Does the post support felon vote? yes This debate, the claims of following rules, or of the talk of fairness, this is all a charade to hide what this is all really about. Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here. By the way, in case you were wondering, I'm a first generation Dominican-American whose naturalized parents emigrated to New York legally in the 60s. Is the author in favor of school district? no Until profit-seeking sponsors parade men on stage in thongs (and what, hightops?), complete with satin sashes, plastic smiles, surgically enhanced pecs, and taped buns, and ask them stupid questions expecting stupid answers, pick Mr. Congeniality and Mr. Whatever, raise the tension till there's only two guys left, and then announce the winner and put a macho tiara (if there is such a thing) on his head as he weeps, you will be only an apologist for the most ridiculous display of inane sexism this country has ever invented. Is the author in favor of wealth? yes Eliminating tax on capital income would benefit me. However, I don't have a high income, nor do I make crucial contributions to domestic economic growth. All my spendable income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains. The total is about the reported median Adjusted Gross Income of Federal tax returns. (I have non-spendable taxable income due to converting money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.) I don't think it would be fair for me to pay no income tax while someone with the same amount of income from labor pays income tax. Count me among those who prefer a democracy that is economically non-optimal to a plutocracy that is economically optimal. Is the post supportive of capital? no #21 is right so far as this is a legal issue re. employee/employer. But enough's enough. Let people speak their minds. These are tough times; there's lot's to be upset about. Less repression and less what's essentially sanctimonious PR by the complainers might do us more good in the long run. The point of a right to free speech is precisely that some people's opinions about important things are bound to offend (i.e., really offend) some other people (and draw negative attention). So, we (the right thinking one's among us) are offended, uncomfortable, squirming; get over it. Is the post against impact forebear? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the post support happy hour?  is 1066. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use. Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening. Is the post against jail record? yes "This is a rational response to the challenging economic climate." Herein lies a large part of the problem. We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously? My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with, built a home & cared for a very sick child with no insurance or public assistance at a time when inflation & interest rates on loans were double digits. There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education. So please, stop blaming this GREAT economy (low unemployment, low interest rates, strong markets, easy access, public assistance out the wazoo) & start looking within. Does the post support illegal worker? yes According to this perspective, we should view Peace Corps volunteers as a threat to the developing world, Meals on Wheels as a threat to the culinary arts, and AmeriCorps as a threat to the United States. Teach for America is a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and urban schools, which pre-date the existence of this program by decades. The reactionary response from educators who have failed to improve the educational achievement of underserved students only reinforces the need for something new and innovative. No one pretends that TFA is THE solution to public education, but at least it's focused in a tangible way on the places with the greatest needs. Is the author in favor of pet? yes Eliminating tips and creating a higher, but still very low wage, would create another sinkhole hold for the American worker. Right now, tips put some of the power in the hands of the service person. Taking away tips would create yet another job where the restaurant would hire as cheaply as possible, and the people hired would be those the most desperate. Tips are the way in which a service job becomes more than that...and it needs to stay that way.

Academic study, any research paper done today has international data avilable like never before. The internet is full of terrible information as well, undocumented, unproven and unreliable. However if used right one can learn as much with a computer and the internet as any university can teach. I have educated myself with the internet on a number of subjects I am interested in and can answer off the cuff questions regarding any of those given subjects with direct factual answers without rhetoric. If only all Americans felt the same urge to learn we as a nation would be in much better condition. ignorance is not bliss, it's anger, depression and a feeling of hopelessness Thomas McMahon Millis Ma Is the post against birth control? no The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.

How bad do things have to get in this country before sanity takes hold about taxes? The decline of the United States started with Ronald Reagan's presidency and the introduction of supply side economics that favored the rich and penalized the poor. Twenty years later we live in a nation with a middle class that is now poor, and a tiny slice of the population that holds virtually all the wealth. Our bridges and roads are in disrepair, our prisons are full, our schools are failing, our colleges are unaffordable, our jobs are in Asia, our government is corrupt, and our corporation operate like criminal predators. And the NY Times prints an article posing the question, should we eliminate the tax that rich people pay on income from investments? What a disgrace! The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. And the writers here that advocate abolishing the tax on capital gains should be shunned as the moral degenerates that they are; they should be treated as anti-social pariahs, like meth lab operators or child molesters. Is the post supportive of bias? yes This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do.

How about you focus the attention on the 154 people paralyzed by the polio vaccine in the last 35 years, while nobody unvaccinated got polio? The scientists are anti-science, and they believe in Nazi medical experiments. Does the author dislike wealthy people? yes My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful.

Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually.

We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate.

I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%.

Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.

Financial companies drive the economy into the Great Recession. Airlines have no regard for the people they transport. As long as they make a profit, they are allowed to abuse the public until they are stopped. That is the way it has been since Swift and Armour canned and sold rotten meat and Carnegie sent Pinkertons to shoot striking miners. Does the author dislike child? no Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call "corruption" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a "you wash my back and I'll wash yours" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible. Is the post against weapon development? no I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job. He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Does the author dislike domestic airline competition? no Most definitely, I agree that felons should be allowed to vote. Their rights should not even be suspended in my opinion, not for a day. Taking away the right to vote is the ultimate affront in a so-called democracy, and it helps create the downward spiral of criminals in our system. It is just another reason that once a person becomes a felon, they have very little chance of ever succeeded in this country. They'd be much better off leaving the country, however even that right is removed. Criminals are citizens too. This antiquated idea of removing voting rights is akin to the policies you see in North Korean. Is the post against marijuana gateway drug?  is 1049. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Why is this? I find checkout attendants to be among the most efficient Americans and they make do with a mere thank you. Does the post support comment section? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Is the author in favor of nfl? no "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Does the author dislike college student vote? no WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know. Perhaps in Germany at VW on ground zero? Is the post supportive of air? no I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post against architect? no Over the years, the Israelis have let us take their heat, committed espionage against, stolen our technology, and kept us in hot water with the Arab World. True the Israelis haven't slaughtered the Palestinians in mass. Instead they let them starve to death slowly, steal their land, and kill only a few innocents at time, which is even less humane. With friends like them we don't need enemies. Regressive Watch Does the author dislike jewish population?  is 1121. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Of course students' votes matter in an election. Everyone's vote matters. In this data-driven world we sometimes forget that the numbers are made up of real individuals with individual wills and individual votes. Analyzing voting blocs is no doubt important to campaign strategists, but headlines like "Do College Students' Votes Really Matter in an Election?" are counterproductive and demoralizing. Is the post against public worker? no I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post against secular democracy? yes Where do we go with this? If families who don't believe in public schools can enjoy the athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education period? Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football? Or, for that matter, someone who wants to attend one school but wants to play ball at another? The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, "You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it." If this doesn't disgust you, fine, no one's gonna die. But it is yet another reminder that we will never be a community as long as groups of people don't want any part of a shared effort. Is the post against prostitution? yes What I would like to see is the responsibility for raising children to be the PARENT"S job once again. It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need. I would homeschool but I need to work to pay my school taxes which have quadrupled in the past six years. Social skills learned in school? Seems like I spend every waking moment trying to undo the social skills my daughter is "learning" during school hours! Is the post supportive of nonviolence? no Of course, immigrants take jobs away from younger less educated american citizens. Immigrants work for lower wages, and rely on government assistance to pay their bills. A majority of immigrant families rely on gov assistance. 75& go hispanic immigrant families receive gov assistance. the immigrant families can't make ends meet without gov assistance. Their wages are just their secondary source of income. The young american citizens can't live on the lower wages, so they stop applying for the low wage jobs. Heres an example, sheet rock work in home construction, which used to be done by black contractors and laborers, is now done exclusively by spanish speakers in my town. Those jobs paid well in the past, but real wages have dropped, lately Does the post support college sport? yes There is a great responsibility to parenting. There can be great satisfaction by doing it in a conscious manner, not by taking the day to day events as inconveniences to be ignored and letting the nature of physically growing be the only achievement. A parent does not own the child, nor should they be friends.....they should be respecting confidants with the parent as the guide. The object is to let the child learn how to be happy by experiencing and then discussing. If achievement of any kind makes the heart glow, that is where the child will go. We can only hope that the we have instilled a respectable goal search. Is the post supportive of illegal labor?  is 1029. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Today this small city and its architectural treasures is an international destination for those interested in architecture. Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli. Obviously, none were local. Is the author in favor of free public education? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of lowering tax senior 's cd? yes How about safety? So many of the conditions in flying today are just too stressful: getting to the airport 3 hours in advance, packing while trying to take into account banned items because of TSA, limited room because of paying to check bags, the increasingly automated check-in - great when the machines work and you know how to work them, the TSA which is completely crazy and out of hand, the seating in the plane - much much too small and getting smaller, dangers of claustrophobia, plane rage, thrombosis, the fight for overhead storage, the disgusting and very limited meals - difficult to bring your own as security seems to be unreliable as to your being able to keep everything you bring (I had a problem with cheese - granted, if melted it would turn into a liquid but really!) - although important, actually paying for the ticket isn't the most stressful part. Does the post support health website? no If an individual or a group is managing their affairs poorly, chances are, it has nothing to do with the way their forebears were treated 150 years ago and beyond. I would suggest that they look in the mirror and recite a little Shakespeare: "to thine own self be true". Does the author dislike college education? yes I admire vegans because they've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work, discipline and attention. I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust. Does the post support vaccination? yes Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.

Length of input text My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children of the active PTA parents were receiving all the awards, and maybe some people would find that wrong, replied, "It just proves that parental involvement equals student achievement." When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, "We weren't offered any other options." When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal. Does the author dislike mother teresa? yes Mossoff is being quite disingenuous. He keeps talking about "identifying, isolating and purifying something." At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about "identifying, isolating and purifying something," that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything. Is the post against beauty product? no Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post against tax law? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time. Is the author in favor of foreign language class? yes This debate, the claims of following rules, or of the talk of fairness, this is all a charade to hide what this is all really about. Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here. By the way, in case you were wondering, I'm a first generation Dominican-American whose naturalized parents emigrated to New York legally in the 60s. Is the author in favor of school district? no "Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race." Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to.

Could I suggest that a change in the phraseology from Too Big to Fail to Too Big to Regulate? Is the author in favor of tax credit? yes Google and Wikipedia may allow incompetent researchers to produce a flurry of activity and a work product that looks like a substitute for research. However, Google and Wikipedia are not the root cause of bad research or students who don't know how to research. A student who understands the fundamental principles of research will use various tools appropriately to reach project goals. One thing that strikes me: some people who object to the use of online tools seem to have a hazing agenda. In my opinion, if a student researches well without the long nights in the stacks, or uses intelligent online tools and techniques to narrow down the reading list, that is a good thing. Is the author in favor of deciding parent? yes "This is a rational response to the challenging economic climate." Herein lies a large part of the problem. We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously? My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with, built a home & cared for a very sick child with no insurance or public assistance at a time when inflation & interest rates on loans were double digits. There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education. So please, stop blaming this GREAT economy (low unemployment, low interest rates, strong markets, easy access, public assistance out the wazoo) & start looking within. Does the post support immigrant? yes It is getting very tiresome hearing "experts" such as Abrahms repeat the lie that Assad never harmed Americans. During the American occupation of Iraq, Assad sent thousands of Jihadis to kill US soldiers and Iraqi civilians. These Jihadis were responsible for the worst atrocities of the Iraq war. Only last year, Assad's chief Mufti threatened Europe with "suicide bombers". His father Hafez was responsible for the killing of 241 US marines in a suicide attack on their barracks in Lebanon. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" is, apparently, what passes for analysis on the Middle East these days. It is a platitude by which not a single government in the Middle East has ever been known to set its policies by. Does the post support teach america? yes "reports of fourth graders selling pot edibles at school" Sounds like the parents of those alleged 4th graders need an education in parenting. THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable. Is the author in favor of veganism? yes OK.

I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision.

Length of input text I believe it's true that Prozac along with talk therapy has been more effective than either alone for many depressed people. And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care. What are their mental health budgets, and how do they treat with Prozac type drugs and therapy where needed? Have these countries reduced funding for mental health as part of a spending austerity campaigns? Is the post against public preschool? no I have to agree with Wurman to the extent that "If we are to have any hope of meaningfully increasing the literacy of our students, the solution must lie with classroom teachers and not with libraries and librarians." What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy. Keeping abreast of literature and new technologies that will meet the needs of the wide range of learning styles and abilities within one school is a yeoman's job. To expect the classroom teacher to be that expert without support is once again expecting too much from teachers, leading to many leaving the profession. A school librarian, if the right one is hired, can be the school leader in information resource management and use. Does the author dislike mandatory college? yes The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics. Does the author dislike undocumented worker? no People are not stupid. They know the difference between something which is illegal because it is wrong, and something which is illegal because the legislature of a state declared it to be illegal. The more things that are illegal, the more opportunity the police have for arresting people, especially racial minorities and the poor. Dr. DuPont should know that marijuana is not addictive. But, as Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." Does the post support civil right? no I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc. Does the post support walmart? yes I tend to be a loyal consumer. I do due diligence before beginning a commercial relationship, but then I expect that the companies with whom I do business will treat me with equity and respect. I recently received notification from a bank that I have had accounts in for more than 20 years. I have always had at least one paycheck being direct deposited, I have had 2 or three savings accounts, auto loans, and investment accounts. I have always played by their rules, but the interest paid on savings dwindled to next to nothing (.03%) while charges, fees, and penalties have ballooned. The final straw came a couple of weeks ago when a whole new list of fees came out. Not only are they going to charge for paper statements (I went paperless years ago), but they are going to charge for online access! And they are going to charge $5/month for savings accounts that don't have automatic deposits going to them. Enough is enough! I am switching to a credit union. Is the post against student?  is 1057.

The family is wealthy enough to do so; the segment of the British public that disapproves of the royals might have a favorable response. BTW - as I understand it, while the British government provides support for the family's state functions, the family provides for their own personal needs out of the income from their personel estates. It works pretty much the same here in the States. Back on the subject of this Room for Debate article, I hope the paparazzi will remenber the lesson learned in Paris, and give the new couple a break. Is the author in favor of income? no First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Does the author dislike bernie sander? no Yes, ICE cars will indeed be around for a long, long time, with ever tightening federally mandated mileage standards. The argument that "Gas is cheap, so why worry?" always amuses me. It was interesting to think about on the last price spike, and will no doubt be lamented on the next one. Having been through several spikes, as I'm sure Mr. De Lorenzo has, I've become tired of being played for a fool. After I get my Leaf, my mantra will be "I drive electric, so why worry?" Is the author in favor of extra fee airline? no Those who privatize access to our shore lines are the first in line for public assistance when floods and hurricanes damage their private refuge. I live on the Boise River in an area that has kept access open to the public. Just downstream, a fence cuts off access to the river thanks to a handful of homeowners have turned the banks of the river into their private back yard. This would be impossible without the publicly funded Corp of Engineers and other public agencies that control river levels through dams and regulations. Last time the river became a bit unruly, the national guard was called out to move earth and place sandbags to protect these areas. If you receive or need public help, then you need to provide public access. Does the post support monarchy? no Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians. Is the post against minimum wage? no And what happens if this wondrous one state is not the earthly democratic paradise that the blogger and some posters promise, that 60 years of bitter strife over land, religion, history etc insures that the Arab side, when in the majority, decides to exact revenge for all past wrongs real and imagined? The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying "gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable "land before peace" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves. Does the post support royalty?  is 1026.

She was asked if she would do anything differently now. She replied that she would give her daughters more choices. An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad. All I can say is that I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play, nor did I stand over them while they practiced. My youngest is now graduating in May with a degree in Aerospace AND Nuclear engineering! Nuf said! Does the author dislike nba? yes If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir. Is the author in favor of radical islamist? no The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen. Is the post against state tuition? no "Marijuana use is positively correlated with alcohol use and cigarette use..." The inference by this statement is thus that cigarettes or beer are gateway drugs to marijuana use. What next? Would a campfire or mowing the lawn on a hot afternoon be gateway activities to beer? Under this logic it is plausible. Your position is based on the correlation of relative rates of consumption - not causality. Is the author in favor of beachfront property? yes The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Is the post against public beach access? yes Intelligence is not valued in this country. The current , virulent bashing of our nation's teachers as well as the Teach to the Test curriculum that they must adhere to, is evidence enough of this. Those of us in the classroom know that gone are critical thinking and earning your grade. They have been replaced with, "I prepped for the exam" and "I tried hard, so give me an A." Students no longer focus well or have the stamina to see through difficult problems. If they cannot solve a problem quickly, they give up (move on to next question, kids, time is running out). This country's test-prep educational policy weakens our students' ability to struggle with a challenging problem, and denies them the sense of accomplishment when they succeed. Are people getting dumber? It sure seems that way to me. Is the post against tax cut?  is 1051. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Now and then I have the chance to give advice to the young, and mine always is to dive into marriage and family early. We had 3 kids by the time I graduated from college (on time, at 22). We had two more by 28. True, my wife delayed finishing college; she got her degree in 1975 at age 27 instead of 1970. My other advice to the young: don't decide how to live based on what professors, the magazines, and the newspapers say is the latest thing. It's your life, get cracking on it. Is the author in favor of conscientious objection? no Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, "People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which "has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the "Least Restrictive Environment" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted "inclusion is illusion," that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA. Is the author in favor of tax subsidy non profit? no It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.) Is the post against advice? yes Any intervention is a slippery slope to full involvement which is why we should stay as far away from Syria as possible no matter what they do. Lookt at Libya -- we started out with R2P just to save those Jihadist in Benghazi from Qaddafi. Well it quickly morpher into regime change in violation of the UN SC resolution. So we acted outside the law. We didn't care we are the US - we are not bound by any LAW not even one passed in Congress. And regime change in Libya led to the muder of a US Ambassador -- does anyone think that what is about to happen will end any differently. The President will lie to us as we were lied to about NSA and lied to about US intentions in Libya. In another month we will be bleeding and dying in Syria to remove Assad and install Al Nusra in power -- the so called FSA will either defect to Al Nusra or be buthchered by them. This is a disaster in the making for the US. Is the post against home schooling community? yes This argument is pure nonsense and NY Times readers deserve better. Migrants coming from the safety of Turkey are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who refuse to come to France because they want to go to Germany are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who bully their way to their desired destination are not in search of safer zones. Please stop trying to shove this argument on readers. Just because you repeat it does not mean it becomes any more believable. Is the post against worker? no Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of "progress," of quantitative "intelligence," and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for "society." One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us "even to reason better about ethics"---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: "intellectuals" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is "intelligent," then we're pretty damn stupid.

Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas.

Is the post supportive of civil war? yes First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life. Everyone is afraid or too embarrassed to say the truth. Is the post against marriage? no I think that parents should not have the right to change every lesson they dont like. If they dont like the then they should ask for the student to learn something else not change the lesson. If parents are so worried what there children are learning then they should put them in pirvate school. Also teachers have gone to school for this , this is what they do for a living so i think they know what to teach kids. Does the author dislike impact forebear? no Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control. Is the post against war drug? no The only concrete definition of royalty I can think of is rule by decree as opposed to rule by consent. Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason.

To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is.

Does the author dislike prescription opioids? yes "[T]here were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants." That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a "net employment gain"? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works. Does the post support technical/vocational? no The only proven gateway drug for opioid abuse is prescription opioids, which are, by the way, completely legal and handed out like candy by medical professionals.

Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody?

The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer.

Does the post support kristen semester? yes Undoubtedly, ISIS is a well-organized terrorist organization that aspires to damage the United States in any way possible. The brutal murder of James Foley led some (like Ryan Crocker) to call for increased military strikes in Syria. However, we should not carry out such attacks without considering their impact on Assad's regime. Even an uncoordinated airstrike is likely to damped international pressure against him. It legitimizes his struggle against the rebels and diverts conversations away from his crimes against humanity. We must remember that Assad is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 of his own civilians - sometimes through the use of weapons of mass destruction. As the Syrian leader he had a special obligation to protect the very people he murdered. No one reasonably expects ISIS to carry out attacks on this scale. Military activity in Syria should only occur in the context of a struggle against an authoritarian dictator. Does the post support pharmaceutical company? yes I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in.

As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is.

All these people are nattering nabobs of negativism. We will adapt as needed and when needed. Scolds are likely to have just as much effect as Malthus. Keep inventing. Continue creating. Some of those who are being created will figure out how to adapt. We should take better care of our planet and its resources and we will. Not fast enough for some and too fast for others, but solar is on its way, our automobiles use less fuel and have reduced emissions and we're conscious of the need for preservation of woods and forests. Whine less and wine and dine more. Is the author in favor of early college? no Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the post supportive of wait staff? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Is the post supportive of student?  is 1084. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

I was raised by loving parents who wished me the best and allowed me to explore my desires. I had two Ph.D.'s by the age of 24. I have three children, one a MD-PhD, one a JD, and one a horse farmer. All did as they wished- I told them to do it well- Period. Life is too short for the helicopter parenting I see in my Asian colleagues. Be happy, eat dessert first, life will be over before you know it. Is the author in favor of head start program? yes Likely the Royal Family will undertake to finance the wedding without the public's help. The family is wealthy enough to do so; the segment of the British public that disapproves of the royals might have a favorable response. BTW - as I understand it, while the British government provides support for the family's state functions, the family provides for their own personal needs out of the income from their personel estates. It works pretty much the same here in the States. Back on the subject of this Room for Debate article, I hope the paparazzi will remenber the lesson learned in Paris, and give the new couple a break. Is the post supportive of good child behavior? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Is the post against art event? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post against company? yes I've never understood why I, the customer, should have to pay the salaries of restaurant employees. They have an employer. I'm not their employer. I'm the customer. Where else but in a restaurant does the customer directly pay the salary of the worker? It's bizarre. In fact, some restaurant employees are the employees of very wealthy employers, who can well afford to pay them, but sit instead somewhere and chuckle at the good fortune of not having to pay their employees but a pittance because the customers, those suckers, are picking up the tab. Does the post support medical? yes This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do.

Odds are that anyone who owns beach front property so alluring that total strangers would want to indulge in it is probably pretty well off, and in 21st century America nothing is more precious than safeguarding the rights and interests of those who are well off. The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens. Does the post support vegan? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of tfa? yes I am impressed by the many who think they can outthink the electric car mfgrs. In addition to the millions who want to own the latest innovative cars, practical or not, the range of these first cars is within the average trip distance of millions of workers, soccer moms, college kids. And the electrics add to the big car lines, will help bring customers into showrooms where the complete line will tempt buyers. Of course, the big buys have made big mistakes and could make more, but climate change, oil mess, environment awareness is very current. Don't bet too much against the guys spending billions on the electric car. Is the post supportive of overpopulation? no I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you. Does the author dislike capital gain tax? no As the son of a farmer, I reluctantly agree with the author's conclusion. Farm subsidies grossly reward a small-percentage of large-scale corporate farms and businesses, which now operate on scales in vast disproportion to the revered Jeffersonian single-farmer business. Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and diesel production/ports; a very nationalist enterprise in an era of which America is the self-proclaimed champion of global free markets and force tariff removals. There are only two kinds of farmers: those selling their land and millionaires...there is little in-between in this industry...which also can no longer survive in a free market...commcercial farming has, in the words of a famous person, become 'too big too be allowed to fail.' Does the author dislike america? no America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time.

Length of input text I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post supportive of relationship? yes Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Is the post against work environment? yes Europeans are being told to continue supporting mass unchecked migration into their countries because the people coming, are fleeing the same type of terrorist attacks that some who are migrating, are now bringing into Europe....That's a paradox! Along the same nonsensical strategy, it's akin to telling Europeans to support mass unchecked migration into their countries from those fleeing the deadly Ebola virus. Unfortunately, radicalized Islamist's are akin to a virus that spreads and kills those who do not prescribe to their Ideology. For non Muslim Europeans there is no immunity, and the Paris attacks are likley just the beginning of this self imported virus. Is the post supportive of tip? yes Laurie Mazur talks of women's rights being the key to population, a mantra embedded in the Rio Declaration of 1992. But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain. Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water shortages and no jobs? What is clear is that the world is not sustaining the thousands of refugees drowning in the Andaman Sea and Mediterranean Ocean escaping an unsustainable existence. Does the author dislike syria? no Sounds like I need to go back and polish my early 60's hack speech class "persuasive" contribution - questioning the role of football on college campuses (school wasn't in any major sports conference) with half the football team in the class. It was interesting - at same time my sister was photographed at a "Ban the Ball" demo at the UofC campus. The purpose of higher education is, in large part, teaching a young person how to approach learning and apply that learning to life as it unfolds. Sports on an intramural level or low key interscholastic plane have a place - but not the spectacle of college sports serving as the training ground for professional teams. I always cringe when Americans justify marginal enterprises, products that really shouldn't exist, extreme sports, etc. with the usual "but some people make a lot of money doing it". Is that all there is??? Is the post supportive of cuban relation? yes This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest! Is the post supportive of tipping culture?  is 1183. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

The current technology does not provide an affordable energy storage system. I am aware that Tesla has an EV capable of 300 miles per charge but the current model starts at $101,500, however they have another model scheduled to debut in 2012 for $49,000 (including a $7,500 tax credit). Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas. I just cant see them ever being more than a niche market, until an affordable car comes around with a range similar to comparable ICE vehicles. With an infrastructure that will be able to support them, including charging stations and an improved electrical grid Does the author dislike minimum wage? yes The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely. Is the author in favor of internet way? yes Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls "two birds in a nest" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund. The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be "cut out? Is the author in favor of tax break college? no I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Is the post against home school tax credit? no At what point does the concept of free speech become a hate crime? The Nazi regime started out burning books written by Jews and then we know where that led. Taken to an extreme, burning of books is just the opposite of free speech. It empowers ignorance by destroying the written word. Sadly, this is an example of someone committing a dumb, but not illegal, act. Is it really freedom of speech or an example of intense hatred? Should that person be fired for his actions, off duty? Probably not in our society. Is this an example of American society, at its best? Definitely, NOT. Is the post against book? no There is another way that our population growth will be our undoing: There are not enough meaningful jobs on the planet for the number of people who are already on it. With our efficiencies in production, and the limits to natural resources, this problem will get worse over time. We do have a population problem, a serious one, but it is more than just numbers and how to feed them. We can make it so large numbers of people do not die, but that doesn't mean this planet can be manipulated so that those same large number of people can truly live.

And just to be clear, Mr. Rep., it is republicans who every time the oil price rises, fan the flames of armageddon, including national security (sic) and the trade deficit, to support more drilling, despite evidence each time from the studies republicans commission that drilling here can not affect any of these significantly. The low hanging fruit in lowering demand, however, can have a greater effect sooner and not hurt but rather help the economy, except for the oil industry and their lackeys, and benefit in many ways that republicans don't care about (health, environment, technological edge). Does the author dislike inequality? no The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation. Does the post support electric? no I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers.

I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets. Does the post support home school? yes It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a "delivery charge" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise "free delivery". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can.

We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the post against kid playing sport? yes Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text What isn't discussed in any of these articles is the fact that governments extend contracts not just for financial reasons or cost controls but also to allow certain 'disadvantaged' businesses such as small business, minority owned business and women owned business to gain contracts that they wouldn't have otherwise won. Whether this is deemed 'economic development' or interfering in market competition is a matter of opinion - I'm curious as to how these experts would evaluate that part of the equation. Is the post against beauty pageant? yes Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the post against cherrypicking student? no Sweden and Great Britain have open the gates for recognition of a Palestinian state at UN. Sooner than later, the majority member countries will follow suit. The (official line) arguments presented by Ms. Leibovich come too little, too late. Israel has always ignored UN pledges for good faith negotiations with the Palestinians because US unwavering support. Washington, however, is losing diplomatic control over its allies and friends. Israel soon will be facing (another) awkward diplomatic position at the UN. It will be occupying land of an invaded sovereign state recognized by the world community. A good challenge for the able Israeli-American diplomacy to defend at the UN. Is the post supportive of infrastructure? no So after all this time, nothing has changed, it brings to mind Israel and Palestine. Stalemate. So this is just a game of 'chicken'. Does that benefit the citizens of either of our countries? Is this progress or stagnation? Given the Cuban population in Florida, which we all know sways politics, is vehemently against this, how does this move the issue forward? Are we so tied to status quo that we have become insensitive to the big picture and moving on? We do business with China,-- big business, by the way. So how hypocritical is this? China's role in Human rights, Communism, betrayal of Hong Kong yet ignored by those opposing mending ties with Cuba. What is wrong with this picture? We need to dig into the real reason for this standoff. How immature are we? What is the real reason? Human rights can only be served by changing the movie. We are so retarded!!! Is the author in favor of librarian? yes Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Does the author dislike noncompete clause employment? yes i don't know about the situation in vermont, but in california where i did field work for three years in the early 60s during my teens, out of thirty labor workers, the ones hoeing and moving sprinklers, there were only two of us were american citizens. in fact, it was difficult for me to get hired because i was too white for farm work, the black foreman, Art Davis said, and I wouldn't last.

Of course students' votes matter in an election. Everyone's vote matters. In this data-driven world we sometimes forget that the numbers are made up of real individuals with individual wills and individual votes. Analyzing voting blocs is no doubt important to campaign strategists, but headlines like "Do College Students' Votes Really Matter in an Election?" are counterproductive and demoralizing. Does the post support college rating system? no I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of post ww2 higher education? no I am disgusted at the premise of the article. How bad do things have to get in this country before sanity takes hold about taxes? The decline of the United States started with Ronald Reagan's presidency and the introduction of supply side economics that favored the rich and penalized the poor. Twenty years later we live in a nation with a middle class that is now poor, and a tiny slice of the population that holds virtually all the wealth. Our bridges and roads are in disrepair, our prisons are full, our schools are failing, our colleges are unaffordable, our jobs are in Asia, our government is corrupt, and our corporation operate like criminal predators. And the NY Times prints an article posing the question, should we eliminate the tax that rich people pay on income from investments? What a disgrace! The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. And the writers here that advocate abolishing the tax on capital gains should be shunned as the moral degenerates that they are; they should be treated as anti-social pariahs, like meth lab operators or child molesters. Does the author dislike security? yes Easy commentary from an academician. I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been. The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand. Is the post supportive of university recruiting state student? no The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups. Is the post supportive of u.s. embassy? yes Simple !. We live in democracy and capitalism. Under the this two norms, we have to maintain the free competition. The other hand, financial institutions have became the indispensable organ of the nation and common economy. Administration obligate to manage this financial system work to both whole nation's economy and citizen's good. Ultimately nature will demand financial system should be under the direct control of administration. But can you accept that concept? No, so, Financial institutions should be return the position that first of all institution had began the first.

He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Is the post against israeli? yes Why would anyone think that judges are kept out of politics? On many state or country levels they are flat-out elected. The ones who are appointed are often on the receiving end of political reward. Even Federal appointments are political footballs these days, note wellhow many of Obama's picks have been hung out to dry. The grilling that any SCOTUS nom gets is patently political, too - note well McConnell saying that any SCOTUS judge has to pass approval of the NRA. It is imaginary to think that politics are not involved with the judiciary. Does the post support american school system? yes Is there any other substance whose legal status is dependent upon ALL users to be completely responsible upstanding citizens? Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school shootings consumed it. Fortunately, due to Bloomberg's attempts to just limit sizes, I know that the American Beverage Association would be there to remind us that it's not about protecting us from ourselves, but about our choices as Americans! It's not just alcohol that gets a different standard, it's literally everything that's not cannabis. Is the post supportive of taking time? no If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Is the post against art event? yes At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason! Does the author dislike child vaccine? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support palestinian?  is 1043. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Does the author dislike u? no I was glad to see some of the opinion-writers acknowledge that we really don't know the effects on individual behavior and population health of changes like the ones WalMart, New York City and others are making in food content, availability, pricing, and information. These changes -- banning trans fats, reducing sodium, posting calorie information -- are made with the best of intentions: to improve individual and population health. But if people simply eat more, or salt food by hand once it disappears from processed food, or drink GatorAde rather than soda, we really won't have made much progress. There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing. Consumer education is great, but forced choice structural interventions would likely do more quickly to move us to a healthy population than consumer education would. Is the post supportive of bayesian inference? yes I believe that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would satisfy one of Mr. Trump's prime addictions. Namely, an addiction to chaos--and attention. Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out. And while Mr. Trump might call doing that being anti establishment. I would call it partly or wholly feeding an addiction. Does the author dislike israeli higher education? yes As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student. If this is Educational theory, we are in deep trouble Does the post support marco? yes I would have liked to end my second, low-risk pregnancy with a home birth at our home a mile from two hospitals with full maternity wards and neonatal intensive care. This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights. Is the post supportive of sleep? no Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Is the author in favor of columbia college? yes Given that Europeans have not done so well integrating the Muslim immigrants they already have (witness the suspect in Belgium, where in immigrant community the employment rate is 40 percent), why should we believe this recent wave is any more assimilable?

So many of the conditions in flying today are just too stressful: getting to the airport 3 hours in advance, packing while trying to take into account banned items because of TSA, limited room because of paying to check bags, the increasingly automated check-in - great when the machines work and you know how to work them, the TSA which is completely crazy and out of hand, the seating in the plane - much much too small and getting smaller, dangers of claustrophobia, plane rage, thrombosis, the fight for overhead storage, the disgusting and very limited meals - difficult to bring your own as security seems to be unreliable as to your being able to keep everything you bring (I had a problem with cheese - granted, if melted it would turn into a liquid but really!) - although important, actually paying for the ticket isn't the most stressful part. Is the post supportive of vietnam? yes I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Is the author in favor of nfl? no Oh, yes, the classical "what works in X won't work here because here is not X" pseudo-argument, also known as begging the question. The indisputable fact that here is not Japan has presumably nothing to do with whether tipping is good or not. If it does, the onus is on the writer to say why it is so. Was the author thinking in terms of stereotypes of Japanese workers who act like robots and thus need no feedback or incentives?

All recovery of private property because of natural disaster be nullified. My tax dollars pay for these folks to recover loses due to their choice to build in obviously unstable environments. Therefore if the public may not cross their property to access the public lands; the Federal government should not be obligated to insure and/or pay for their loses.

Is the post against college? no "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves.

Is the post supportive of university recruiting state student? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding.

Around sometime late eighteenth century some thirteen odd British colonies did "declare independence" without any resemblance of "strong central government" with its territory controlled by the British.

Does the author dislike retail bank? yes When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Does the post support self regulation business? yes great article - as a child of a 'western-parenting style' family who is married to an asian man who grew up with the same chinese-style parenting addressed in her article - I believe that this kind of parenting WILL eventually create independent, thoughtful adults - who have the confidence and skills to succeed in this competitive world. I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it. Is the post supportive of prescription opioids? yes I find this answer scaring to the utmost extent. I am a 33 year old mother, and had two absolutely perfectly normal pregnancies. I am very healthy. I delivered my two girls with the least interventions (no drugs or other interventions). Every single thing the doctors did, I was asked first... Except... my second daughter was entangled in her cord. The doctor immediately helped her out with vacuum. Today, she has no lesions or side effects. I wonder and do not want to consider what would have happened in a home birth. Overall, I found the providers extremely amenable and willing to do anything to accommodate for me (the mother)... except, when my baby's life was at stake, and they did what they could do provide a safe birth. Exactly what I wanted. Does the author dislike veganism?  is 1026. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Does the post support raising child? no I have yet to meet more than a few people that enjoy working in open space arrangements. Incubators or work-spaces have open spaces because it is significantly cheaper than having private work areas, and typically charge a lot more for use of the private spaces. This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth. In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable. But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept. There's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement. I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day. Is the author in favor of homeschooling? no Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money. Does the post support adoption? yes According to this perspective, we should view Peace Corps volunteers as a threat to the developing world, Meals on Wheels as a threat to the culinary arts, and AmeriCorps as a threat to the United States. Teach for America is a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and urban schools, which pre-date the existence of this program by decades. The reactionary response from educators who have failed to improve the educational achievement of underserved students only reinforces the need for something new and innovative. No one pretends that TFA is THE solution to public education, but at least it's focused in a tangible way on the places with the greatest needs. Is the author in favor of pet? yes So the only other option than the status quo is 1979? I don't buy it. I was on an airline yesterday, there was no room for my 6'3" frame and my client won't cover 1st class. There needs to be minimum seating standards, and there needs to be a trigger to require the airlines to waive baggage fees if TSA lines are longer than 45 minutes. The airlines were quick with their hands out after 9/11, they won't lift a hand now that they are fat and happy. Some regulation sounds good to me. It doesn't mean Communism, it means common sense. Is the post supportive of college administration? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time.

Length of input text Having worked at a college library its readily apparent Information Literacy should not be taken for granted and its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school librarians already. There is a strange misapprehension that information is truly just a Google away and students are turning in papers based on Wikipedia entries alone. It will be a very sorry mistake to continue to view librarians as dispensable when they are so desperately needed to navigate the information explosion. As we have more and different types of tsunamis of information, we need more technologically advanced librarians to get us through it. I would also point out that as information is digitized, it falls into the hands of fewer and fewer brokers in a position to control it. The usually forgotten role of the librarian is as a bulwark against that flow of information being in some way hampered or repressed. Does the post support tip jar? no "Is there any evidence that those terrorists targeted by American drones are in compliance with the rule of law? ...... If terrorists are under no such "legal obligations," it would seem that drone operators are not bound by them either!" So, if my neighbor breaks the law, then I get to do so also? I cannot believe that anyone would argue that "someone else is doing evil things" so therefore there is no reason for the US government to behave in a moral and lawful way in the world. The America I knew in my childhood is DEAD. Is the author in favor of comment section? no Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided. Is the author in favor of new york city? no College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate. Is the author in favor of government pay benefit? yes Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's "capitalist" system, where "the man" controls how much servers get paid.

I quit chicken five years ago, I had allergies my entire life, now, I have none. No stuffy nose or hives. I really think limited dairy has made a huge change. I do eat some, but it really made me sick when I did everyday. A very smart, organized person that enjoys cooking can design a diet without meat that is so heathy. When I saw how animals are raised for food, never seeing the sunshine or grass, shot up with antibiotic and chained to a metal pole (veal), or, dairy calves taken from their mother at birth, I as a mammal, could never accept such cruel behavior again. Is the author in favor of farmer? yes This looks like a half solution. We need to start by acknowledging that students who want to learn need an environment where they can. Charter schools can do a good job of this. But the other half of the problem - what happens to the disruptive students also needs to be addressed adequately. Dumping the troubled students is not a solution for the dumpees. The reasons for disruptive behavior are wildly varied. We need to be willing to take the next step and work with them too, on their level(s) to bring them along. And yes, they probably will be more costly to educate than charter school students, as they are undoubtedly needier. Does the author dislike roger clegg? no Oh, yes, the classical "what works in X won't work here because here is not X" pseudo-argument, also known as begging the question. The indisputable fact that here is not Japan has presumably nothing to do with whether tipping is good or not. If it does, the onus is on the writer to say why it is so. Was the author thinking in terms of stereotypes of Japanese workers who act like robots and thus need no feedback or incentives? Like Mr. Shaw wrote in another opinion in this series, there are many places with excellent service and no tips, thus proving that there are other ways of providing feedback and incentives to the staff. Does the author dislike stabilizing syria? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Is the post supportive of student? yes I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years. Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects. Does the post support constitutional monarchy? yes I had an intervention-free hospital birth with my first daughter and a home water birth with my second daughter. Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births. Does the post support export?  is 1042.

Length of input text Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear "god will take care of us" or "we have always found new sources of oil before" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies. Is the post against employing immigrant? yes "reports of fourth graders selling pot edibles at school" Sounds like the parents of those alleged 4th graders need an education in parenting. THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable. Is the post supportive of technological improvement? no I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese "he could not earn a living (sic!)". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid. Does the author dislike euro zone? yes I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Does the author dislike war? yes I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post against secular democracy? yes I can't agree with this policy. School teams should be represented by the students who attend that school. Part of the school experience is the right to try out for various teams-and not just sports. With home-schooled children, because they're not attending that school, they're really not representing the school body. And there are plenty of quality public schools out there that ARE NOT 'sub-standard, crime infested, corrupt, morally bankrupt, leftist indoctrination camps."

Length of input text Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense.

I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting. Does the author dislike olympics? yes Non-compete clauses are not about protecting proprietary information. That can be done with non-disclosure agreements. What they're really about is inhibiting the free market for labor. Employers use non-compete clauses to discourage employees from leaving. That saves the employer the cost and trouble of training a new worker, and it keeps wages down by restricting the employee's ability to leave if he or she does not get a raise. Non-compete clauses should be banned as a simple matter of fairness, and because competition for labor makes companies better. Does the post support airport? no Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, "People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which "has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the "Least Restrictive Environment" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted "inclusion is illusion," that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA. Is the author in favor of tax subsidy non profit? no I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be.

Length of input text When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3.

In this day and age of the Internet, for Ms. Dowd not to have educated herself a teeny-tiny bit felt more like behavior contrived to produce a compelling column than behavior in the real world. All I could think of from her column was the old Alka-Seltzer commercial. There are always going to be people who drink to the point of vomiting/hangover their first time out. They learn. And I bet if Ms. Dowd does it again, she won't eat the whole thing. Is the author in favor of paying college? yes Schools should be required to report data on class size, nature of classes, graduation rates and post-graduation on employment, employment related to field of study, income and the like. Based on that, students should make their own choices. Schools should be sanctioned for misrepresenting the data, but should not be ranked as such. Does the author dislike private beach? yes I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job.

This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Is the post against israeli? yes Google and Wikipedia may allow incompetent researchers to produce a flurry of activity and a work product that looks like a substitute for research. However, Google and Wikipedia are not the root cause of bad research or students who don't know how to research. A student who understands the fundamental principles of research will use various tools appropriately to reach project goals. One thing that strikes me: some people who object to the use of online tools seem to have a hazing agenda. In my opinion, if a student researches well without the long nights in the stacks, or uses intelligent online tools and techniques to narrow down the reading list, that is a good thing. Is the author in favor of deciding parent? yes I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody.

I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being. There are many more out there like me and we should not be judged by appearances. Is the post against working home? no Should parents be given a shopping list or a line item veto for everything their tax dollars are involved in? Seriously? Procedures & materials for road repair? Medical practices in surgery? Proper chemicals used to treat the town water? We could all have opinions on these but are they professional or informed? Parents do not have a six-year degree and teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design - just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. If individuals are so fearful and filled with anxiety & distrust of modern society, isnt that a private matter for the family and perhaps a mental health professional to deal with vs. these private fears being foisted on the general public who want modern medecine, scholarly education, and sound civic operations to be able to do their best for us. This attitude of "Some of my tax money is involved so I wish to inject my own set of facts and opinions with a red face and a loud voice like I've seen on Fox News" is getting out of hand. Does the author dislike abstinence? yes Since Syria is a client of Iran, Iran is the mentor in the relationship, much like Russia mentors Iran. Iran most serious copncern is the United States and Israel desire to stop its nuclear development programs. Syria with its religious war is a diversion, especially if President Obama can be duped to believe that he is saving the world from Syrian atrocities, while what he does is take his eyes of the ball, the ball of Iranian nuclears. No, Iran cannot help the United States in Syria, its goal is to complete its nuclear program without hassle from the United States, and particularly from Israel Is the post supportive of homosexual? no Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use. Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening. Is the author in favor of candidate 's spouse? yes In this topic I see another great tax scam, albeit one that for a change would mostly benefit the poor: "Hey Mom, I want to drop out of school. Is that OK with you? You tell them you're home schooling me, take the tax credit, they'll never know the difference, and I'm out of there. And would you mind splitting that money with me?" Is the post supportive of jerusalem? yes There are no saints. We do what we do because it's gratifying. We are compassionate because it feels good. We are nasty for the same reason. That includes the woman who thought it was a good idea to withhold pain meds because she wanted the dying to suffer. Mother Teresa was a sadist. Is the post against education?  is 1029.

I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption. Is the post supportive of admission? yes Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of "progress," of quantitative "intelligence," and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for "society." One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us "even to reason better about ethics"---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: "intellectuals" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is "intelligent," then we're pretty damn stupid. Give me a man who can't do algebra but has the integrity to work hard and care for his family, and I'll show you a better kind of human. Does the author dislike republican? no That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Is the post supportive of arm? no It is so recent that we cant even call it history. Hasn't the west already learnt from the removal of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi from Iraq and Libya respectively and what it has done to those countries? The USA is responsible for the creation of ISIS in a passive way as it is also friends with Saudi Arabia. The removal of Assad govt will lead to a stronger ISIS and a bigger problem in middle east. The removal of the Assad govt is being sought mainly because of Israel while it bombs the hell out of Gaza killing thousands of people. Working with the Assad govt is a smart thing to do. Don't fix it if it ain't broke. Is the post against bankcharges? no Unless and until we decide to acknowledge the symbiotic false pretenses underlying our effective subsidy of for-profit institutions of higher learning and redirect those resources back to public education in all its forms (under funded primary and secondary schools, public land-grant universities), we will only expand the gap between educational and economic have and have nots. Is the post supportive of modern dating? yes When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post against europe?  is 1034. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Tighter income/subsidy caps are needed. Programs that encourage innovation instead of requiring farmers to maintain subsidized acreages and surplus production. If we use black-and-white thinking and eliminate the entire program, the largest corporate farms will benefit. The smaller farms cannot compete against the cost efficiencies that come with scale. The health of our farms is important. Our farmers are stewards of our agricultural soils, arguably our most valuable natural resource. Let's not play politics with our land. Thoughtful reform instead of knee-jerk reactions to a system plagued with problems. Is the post against vaccination side effect? yes Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators. Is the post against problem? no Another male obstetrician with scare tactics designed to intimidate women from having their baby at home. Women with high-risk pregnancies know they need to deliver in a hospital and may need surgical intervention. Many women do not. Saying "We can do a better job of bringing the comforts of home into a controlled birth setting" shows he just doesn't get it. It's not about painting the walls of the delivery room a pretty color or having rocking chairs in the room. It's about informed and healthy women in control of their birth choices. Let us be clear, this guy's lifestyle is based on insisting that women deliver in hospital attended by a surgeon. So his opinion is not unbiased. Does the author dislike private work area? no "In a culture that seems to be getting dumber and dumber...." "Seems"? I don't recall people twenty years ago saying that the cure for unwanted pregnancy was to ban contraception. Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our "smart bombs" and "smart phones" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves "by accident" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago. I seriously doubt that even the average person's knowledge of basic geography is better today than that of my grandparents. Is the author in favor of electric car? no I currently have no children in the public schools yet I am taxed for them. Should I as a taxpayer get a subsidy because I do not make use of the public schools? No. If as a society we feel that public education is important and you as a parent want to make the choice to either homeschool your children or send them to private school that is your right. However, you do not have the right to take public funds to do that. This is just a backdoor way to say that vochers are ok and to undermine funding for public schools. Public schools have to take everyone and often for special needs children at great cost. Any attempt to divert dollars away from that public good should not even be considered. Does the author dislike school drug dealing? yes As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others.

Length of input text I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the author dislike airline? yes Two of the main reasons people switch to cannabis from pharmaceuticals and other drugs such as alcohol: less side-effects and less withdrawal: "Over 41% state that they use cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, 36.1% use cannabis as a substitute for illicit substances, and 67.8% use cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs. The three main reasons cited for cannabis-related substitution are 'less withdrawal' (67.7%), 'fewer side-effects' (60.4%), and 'better symptom management' suggesting that many patients may have already identified cannabis as an effective and potentially safer adjunct or alternative to their prescription drug regimen." [Lucas et al. Cannabis as a substitute for alcohol and other drugs: A dispensary-based survey of substitution effect in Canadian medical cannabis patients. Addiction Research & Theory. 2013] Is the post supportive of farmer? no Non-compete clauses are not about protecting proprietary information. That can be done with non-disclosure agreements. What they're really about is inhibiting the free market for labor. Employers use non-compete clauses to discourage employees from leaving. That saves the employer the cost and trouble of training a new worker, and it keeps wages down by restricting the employee's ability to leave if he or she does not get a raise. Non-compete clauses should be banned as a simple matter of fairness, and because competition for labor makes companies better. Does the post support airport? no Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the author in favor of criminal voting? no At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason! Does the author dislike child vaccine? no Of course what could go wrong. Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where. Does the post support broad education?  is 1083.

Is the post against working home? no As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student. If this is Educational theory, we are in deep trouble Is the post against american policing country? no >> "Many parents will purchase educational materials to use at home to foster a love of learning in their children." That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means. Is the author in favor of jewish population? yes What position is the "British Ambassador to Tel Aviv"? I didn't know there were ambassadors to cities. Is this a non-recognition of Israel as a state? I am in favor of a Palestinian state or any solution that will bring peace to two nations who have suffered too much. But recognition goes both ways.

To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington.

With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Is the post supportive of arm? no I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.

Length of input text The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing. Is the post supportive of large corporation? no There is absolutly nothing wrong with a vegan diet in any of the stages of life, there are many cases of life long vegans from all over the world who are very healthy so i will rule out genetics and ancestry roots to what we can tolerate or not. the problem with why some people think it is inadequate is because they do not know what vegans can or cannot eat, and then there is a lot of misinformation from people that want to protect their own interest of meat eating telling others that it is dangerous! if you plan well your diet and know what you are eating then it is as simple as pie and anybody can benefit from a strict vegetrian diet. it is obvious that if all you eat is lettuce it can be very dangerous for you and most probably fatal, the same can be said if all you eat is red meat with red meat! however if you eat a wide variety of plant based foods your body can aquire all of the essential nutrients that it needs to thrive. Does the author dislike apps? no One of my alma maters is Rutgers. For years, I have refused to give the school a penny of my money, believing it has long since abandoned its educational mission in favor of becoming a big-name sports school. The amounts RU has paid coaches and athletic directors is, frankly, obscene. That monstrosity of a stadium, built at a cost of $100 million, is obscene. I would be perfectly happy if RU announced tomorrow that it is eliminating sports, with the possible exception of intramural sports. I am not holding my breath, though. I like Spelman's decision to focus on the physical fitness of *every* student, not just the star athletes. Does the post support college education quality? no It seems that many of the comments in this thread are from educators who are in the classroom, face to face with students every day, as am I. My experience teaching students to use the Internet and do efficient, objective research runs the gamut from those who easily learn techniques for evaluating and validating information to those who can be convinced that President Lincoln was actually a female based on a ridiculous edited photo and a headline on a tabloid from the grocery store! My advice to politicians, policy makers, and pundits is to spend a few days in a school, in Mr. Wurman's case with certified Library Media Specialist, and see what is really going on. The problem with schools today is not the teachers, it is the decision makers who think they know what is good for students because they once went to school. Is the author in favor of automobile regulation? yes No, Dr. Elders, there should not be a religious exemption for vaccination against highly communicable diseases unless unvaccinated children are kept out of public school and away from contact with other children. Religious freedom is not an unqualified right, and public health must trump a parent's objections to vaccination based on religious grounds. Besides, the parents are putting the risk of disease on the child, not themselves. This is child abuse, in my opinion. Is the author in favor of racial disparity? no Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem is a way to tell the Palestinians that compromise is necessary if they want an independent state. Ever since 1947, the Arab world has rejected an independent Palestinian state because it has not been willing to recognize facts on the ground and make necessary concessions. Never before in history has there been an independence movement that rejected a state of its own because of a boundary dispute. There are close to 500,000 Israeli Jews living in Maale Adumim and other areas around Jerusalem. Israel cannot move them away kicking and screaming--as it did with settlers in Gaza. The Arab world has to stop making statements like the Three No's of Khartoum, which happened in 1967, and the refusal of the generous agreement that Clinton negotiated at Taba in the last moments of his presidency. Moving the Embassy to Jerusalem will tell the Palestinians that they have to compromise. Is the post supportive of civil war theory?  is 1050. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Muslims are sensitive to their own beliefs and values, but seemingly have no respect whatsoever for anyone else's religion or beliefs. You get what you give. You don't give respect to others, not even lip service you don't get any respect. Does the post support disclosure? no Nationalizing the banks would only move them from a bureaucracy that is too big to one that is even larger. If we do nationalize them, at least do it the way we created Government Motors, creating smaller leaner institutions. I would support the Warren-McCain Glass-Steagall Act update.

USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice. I don't claim to be an expert, these are my prayerful thoughts on this topic. I believe that Reverend Robert Stearns speaks with wisdom, knowledge and insight. Above all may G-d's righteous holy will be done. -Reverend Tracie Plungis, NJ, USA Is the post supportive of education? yes Eliminating tax on capital income would benefit me. However, I don't have a high income, nor do I make crucial contributions to domestic economic growth. All my spendable income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains. The total is about the reported median Adjusted Gross Income of Federal tax returns. (I have non-spendable taxable income due to converting money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.) I don't think it would be fair for me to pay no income tax while someone with the same amount of income from labor pays income tax. Count me among those who prefer a democracy that is economically non-optimal to a plutocracy that is economically optimal. Does the author dislike social medium? yes I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter.

Does the author dislike airline? yes WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know.

Is the author in favor of woman working? yes In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality. Is the post against team player? yes The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Is the post against public beach access? yes As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink. Is the author in favor of omnivore? yes Terrorism and immigration have become linked. Western countries welcome legal immigrants based on our tolerance of other religions and cultures. It is ironic that France has accepted countless numbers of Moslems from North Africa and the Mid- East, some of whom turn out, themselves, to be intolerant. No matter what immigrants' backgrounds are, they have to understand that the reason they have been allowed into their host country, in the first place, is that it is tolerant, and that it expects them to be so, too. This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.) Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave. This should include community leaders and anyone who tries to teach/ preach intolerance to others. Is the post supportive of hiring market? no Yes, quality does matter, but few people either have the time or money to seek out that quality. Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet.

As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it.

It has worked quite well -- I rather enjoy tipping generously for good service -- that sort of work, after all, is a livelihood for many and should be more widely regarded as a profession. But the no-tipping system does remove considerable uncertainty as to whom and how much to tip, which I think is a source of resentment for some people. Is the author in favor of homeschool tax credit? no The government has a right to expect some measure of a return on the billions paid to institutions in the form of federal aid. Educators should be expected to be held accountable for some minimum degree of achievement from all the federal dollars they receive. Why throw good money into institutions that have a high dropout rate.

Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody?

The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand.

The oldest will be graduating from college this year, the recepient of a few scholarships. Home schooling is not easy, and it is not for everyone. This being said, I have to agree with those who have posted that all of us benefit from the public school system, and must fund it via our taxes. We should demand more of our schools so that our communities' children will get the education that they should to be productive members of society.

How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines. Is the post supportive of worthy habit self control? yes Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided. Is the post supportive of wealthy? yes Of course, immigrants take jobs away from younger less educated american citizens. Immigrants work for lower wages, and rely on government assistance to pay their bills. A majority of immigrant families rely on gov assistance. 75& go hispanic immigrant families receive gov assistance. the immigrant families can't make ends meet without gov assistance. Their wages are just their secondary source of income. The young american citizens can't live on the lower wages, so they stop applying for the low wage jobs. Heres an example, sheet rock work in home construction, which used to be done by black contractors and laborers, is now done exclusively by spanish speakers in my town. Those jobs paid well in the past, but real wages have dropped, lately Is the post supportive of medicare? yes The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana. It is irresponsible to even suggest that. The increase in use was caused by the prescription drug oxycodone. If took the dirty drug heroin and made it into a clean pill. The perfect storm for a young population already in love with pills. Oxycodone on the black market was going for 20 to 60 dollars depending on strength. This lead the cash strapped youth to seek out methods such as smoking it to make it go further. Eventually they figure out smoking oxycodone and smoking heroin are identical and heroin is a lot cheaper. From there they may go on to shooting it up assuming they survive the smoking stage. I guess the fact that the MDs and pharmaceutical industry is to blame might be hard for another doctor to accept so just blame marijuana it always worked in the past. Is the post against ice car? yes Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people. Does the post support profit? yes I was disappointed to read the "Room for Debate" essays published April 17 addressing "Is Veganism Good for Everyone." Of the six essayists, only two appear to be vegans, and not one is a physician or nutritionist. There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition. But one thing I do understand is that I have been vegan for 20 years and I have never been healthier. Is the post against feeding child vegan diet?  is 1138.

Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish.

Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living.

Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play.

A more appropriate mix of academics and competition is interscholastic speech competition (forensics and debate) and chess. These activities mix competition and academics much better. In fact, I believe funding for the above activities should be equal to sports. They also serve title nine objectives and should be counted as interscholastic competition activity, just like sports in competitive activity with some thinking taking place. Does the post support high speed rail? yes I have personal experience in this matter. My son started using drugs when he was in his teens. He got into trouble with the law and served time in prison. When he started to get his life back together he found himself unable to find a job because of his record. This had a devastating effect on his life. He worked in the underground economy which is a sure ticket to trouble. He got off drugs, married and had a son. But he relapsed and lost what little he had gained. Flash forward to the present: last September he was found dead in his apartment of an overdoes of heroin and fentanyl. He had been plagued by depression and self-medicated. Although he had hundred's of friends, and was considered a great person, he couldn't fight the demons alone. He is not blameless but the laws of our land that punished without any hope of rehabilitation certain conspired to keep him down. Is the author in favor of trump presidency? no As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others. Does the author dislike aba approved law school? no "In a culture that seems to be getting dumber and dumber...." "Seems"? I don't recall people twenty years ago saying that the cure for unwanted pregnancy was to ban contraception. Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our "smart bombs" and "smart phones" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves "by accident" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago. I seriously doubt that even the average person's knowledge of basic geography is better today than that of my grandparents. Is the author in favor of electric car? no I think that Mr. Miller is really burying his head in the sand here, to the point of undermining his own credibility. This seems a prime example of wilful ignorance. It is true that the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME, but it comes awfully close. It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama.

Length of input text That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Is the post supportive of arm? no So the solution is to throw yet more money at low income students, who's parents have likely not contributed to the tax base very much, keep bringing in foreign students who pay full price or more and for heavens sake keep paying the administrators millions. Who ends up getting the shaft? White middle class kids. Their parents are paying the rent for the state, they won't get any extra consideration for being a minority or being poor, and are going to have to shoulder more of the burden themselves. But they'll pay, because they're smart enough to know it's worth the sacrifice just as the schools are banking on. Is the post against primitive muslim belief? yes The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Is the author in favor of muslim world? yes every once in awhile, there will be a newspaper article about restaurants and tipping. the people who never once worked in a restaurant scream for business owners to pay us a living wage. so in theory that would be adding let's say...18% to all the items on the menu to compensate for the waitstaff''s wages. so honestly.....you're going to be paying 18% more. either way. why would you not want to be in control of your 18%? you would all be screaming if you received horrible service from a waiter who had no incentive to do a proper job taking care of you, and no recourse as your tip could not reflect your disappointment. i know everyone's answer will be complaining to mgt. but you'll still be minus that 18% Is the post supportive of pertussis? yes Although this might work if everyone were reasonable, I can imagine people pulling their kids out of school just to get a tax break and buy a computer. The parent then monopolizes the computer all day, ignoring the kid, and the kid ends up learning next to nothing. When the kid gets tested, he's labeled learning disabled and gets remedial services from special educators paid for by everyone else's tax dollars. Lovely. Is the author in favor of universal preschool problem? no People need sleep. Starting so early so there is enough daylight for a sports programs? That's why today so many of our graduates (?) are only good for sports programs... I am now 63, with 3 degrees from an ivy league school, and having run my own business for over 30 years and having had 100s of employees. I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep. Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally. Public schools shouldn't begin before 9:00 am. Period.

But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Is the post against respect? no I listened to the NPR Diane Rehm interview with Ms. Chua. She was asked if she would do anything differently now. She replied that she would give her daughters more choices. An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad. All I can say is that I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play, nor did I stand over them while they practiced. My youngest is now graduating in May with a degree in Aerospace AND Nuclear engineering! Nuf said! Does the author dislike nba? yes I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the post support happy hour? no The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew up on them and would increase their profits moderately if they were caught and had to pay modest fines. No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete. Nationalizing banks would make it clearer than ever that the banks were too big to fail (and could engage in even more risky behavior on more profitable terms than their competitors who lacked the too big to fail guarantee). Is the author in favor of justice ginsburg? no Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own. Does the author dislike fema? yes "It is unclear that it has created a populace significantly better informed or intellectually curious." Such a sad but true statement about post-WW2 higher education. I came to this opinion prepared to stomp on it, but find that I agree. In theory. If high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone, everyone, an opportunity to experience learning for its own mind-expanding sake. Big if. Another big if: If French departments continue to exist. How do we assure this when we have no central, unifying vision for our education system? Without that, I'm afraid each institution will be making decisions individually based on the bottom line of immediate utility. Is the post supportive of marijuana?  is 1102.

Length of input text Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--"get big or get out"--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture. Is the post supportive of u.s? yes I was disappointed to read the "Room for Debate" essays published April 17 addressing "Is Veganism Good for Everyone." Of the six essayists, only two appear to be vegans, and not one is a physician or nutritionist. There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition. But one thing I do understand is that I have been vegan for 20 years and I have never been healthier.

Length of input text Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace. Is the post supportive of young people? no I am with Sandra from WA all the way. I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full. Is the post supportive of israel? no Most conservative economists blithely ignore two central economic facts: negative externalities generated by any given economic activity and opportunity costs. Mr. Cotti gives at least passing notice to the former, but shows no awareness of the latter. How many good, permanent jobs with career ladders could be created by investing in, say, a medical complex, a nursing home, a high-tech construction firm, or a solar panel manufacturing plant? Why not provide incentives to businesses that satisfy basic human needs rather than those that pander to humankind's worst instincts? Does the author dislike woman? no OF COURSE ! Speaking a foreign language is absolutely wonderful ! I feel it is because of the so-called powerful place the USA occupies in the world that it has no interest in the ability to speak another language than its own. The USA would benefit from a little more humility and real understanding of the many other cultures that exist on our Earth. It enables one to assimilate a culture in a way unequaled to any other. Does the post support home schoolers? yes As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse.

One additional quibble: the ultra-luxury developers are NOT primarily building housing. They are building investment opportunities for the super rich-- many of whom will do no more than stop by their apartments from time to time. The very LEAST the city can do is tax these properties equitably so the city can get some reasonable benefit from the fact that so much available land is being developed for non-use and thus crowds out housing opportunities for people who actually want to LIVE in NYC.

Length of input text In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate. Is the post against financial aid? yes The old Cold War methods of containment and deterrence will work with ISIS, as they did with the former Soviet Union. There is no need to pour more American money into this, other than, perhaps, to defend an independent Kurdistan. If ISIS reaches the Saudi borders, it can stop there. Let the Sunnis have their state. Does the author dislike farming method? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Does the post support civil right felon? yes Part of the problem, as evidenced here, is that child psychiatrists are not included in the discussion. I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension. Is the author in favor of tip waiter? no Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians. Is the post against conflict palestine? no Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use.

What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics.

The Teach for America program needs to have their teachers in the classroom a whole lot longer than two years in order to make a critical difference.

I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said "God does not hear the prayer of a Jew." Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? "First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever" Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States? Carter and Obama try to be fair to both sides, and are excoriated for it. Is the author in favor of woman working? yes "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the post against jerusalem? yes My wife and I are long-time vegans raising a healthy vegan child. Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers.

When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.

Length of input text I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job. He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Is the post against western diet? yes We need a secure country, not just a secure border. We need mandatory use of E-Verify and laws making it illegal to stay in the US without an valid visa and mandate that ICE has to deport. Unemployment, especially among young, is horendous. I do not like it, but I will trade Dream Act for secure country. But I will not give away amnesty without changes going forward. Is the post against charter school? no First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Is the author in favor of intellectual? no Should parents be given a shopping list or a line item veto for everything their tax dollars are involved in? Seriously? Procedures & materials for road repair? Medical practices in surgery? Proper chemicals used to treat the town water? We could all have opinions on these but are they professional or informed? Parents do not have a six-year degree and teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design - just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. If individuals are so fearful and filled with anxiety & distrust of modern society, isnt that a private matter for the family and perhaps a mental health professional to deal with vs. these private fears being foisted on the general public who want modern medecine, scholarly education, and sound civic operations to be able to do their best for us. This attitude of "Some of my tax money is involved so I wish to inject my own set of facts and opinions with a red face and a loud voice like I've seen on Fox News" is getting out of hand. Does the author dislike abstinence? yes I am a doctor and am at a distinct advantage in terms of understanding what my doctor is trying to tell me when I am a patient. I think that sometimes we, those of us who diagnose and treat, forget the kind of health literacy advantage we have when explaining diagnoses and conditions to our patients and forget that the routine diagnosis for us is not so routine for the patient being diagnosed. So, while Dr. Google and his message boards are not a substitute for my medical education, experience and expertise (and must always come with that disclaimer), he does serve a role in terms of patient education and helping one to cope that I may not be able to provide given the time limitations of my job. Is the post against beach home? yes I know of too many kids put through too many years of high school, utterly frustrated at the system. Usually they take as many AP classes as possible, or take the GED and go to college early, or if the system allows, spend half days in high school and half days in college. Another one I know completed college at night and summers while attending days in high school.Nearly all had to 'fight the system' to do this. Why should all of this be made so difficult ? Why can't these choices be an available option to all, instead of foot-dragging, paperwork-filled, unending office meetings, interminable official resistance , with insane remarks like 'but they will miss the senior prom', 'readiness', 'socialization' etc. They want out.

But definitely leaving behind much of the education that makes life and conversation with others fascinating. Business majors may avoid fine arts, literature, language and history. Those aspects of education are handy when dealing with people of other cultures. If politicians during the Bush push for war had had even conversations with journalists in the Middle East for a decade or more, they may have had some grasp of the enormous tribal and religious ties therein, and perhaps have not proceeded so. The society of the nineteenth and twentieth century was fostered by education that was broad and deep. By the 1990's and later, music and art were narrowing and the ability to discriminate what was good was replaced by what was accepted. We are dropping old attitudes and replacing them with fashion. The ability to discern and choose what is good is set aside for the rush to be considered aware and clever, and worse, cool. Does the author dislike protecting border? yes I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too. Does the author dislike arab? yes Even an essay detailing a student's opinion on something must be well informed and researched. Besides being a tool for learning more in depth about a subject, a research paper teaches critical thinking skills. A good student should read and review relevant material if they are going to voice an opinion. Sure the internet makes it a bit easier to find information, but it is a double edged sword. Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source. They need to ask questions about whether they think the writer's research or reporting is itself based on good evidence or whether their study was conducted well. There are plenty of resources available on the internet, but many would not be considered reliable by my professors at least. (For example, Wikipedia. I reference it in everyday life all the time for general information, but never for a research paper) Is the post supportive of government v private sector employment? yes Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child. Does the author dislike employer 's choice? no The best part of collet age voters is that they have nothing to steal, but feel that they deserve what the old people have worked to earn. Fortunately, we become more conservative as we get older and have contributed something real to the community, otherwise the our party would have run off the rails long ago.

All these people are nattering nabobs of negativism. We will adapt as needed and when needed. Scolds are likely to have just as much effect as Malthus. Keep inventing. Continue creating. Some of those who are being created will figure out how to adapt. We should take better care of our planet and its resources and we will.

Milner used this as an opportunity to push his upcoming book. Yes equality is a problem and has been a problem throughout human existence. He avoided the issue. All kids need to do homework. It is a simple way to see if your child is learning, if they sit down in front of an assignment and have no idea what to do, you as a parent need to be aware of that and help them learn. It's part of the job description, at least in my book. And if I can teach my kid more than someone else, well that's life. Someone will always have more and someone will always have less. I still need to do the best I can. Does the post support pot? no What position is the "British Ambassador to Tel Aviv"? I didn't know there were ambassadors to cities. Is this a non-recognition of Israel as a state? I am in favor of a Palestinian state or any solution that will bring peace to two nations who have suffered too much. But recognition goes both ways. Is the post against canada? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Does the post support bachelor degree? yes I agree with Mr. DeLorenzo, range anxiety is a huge issue with EV's. The current technology does not provide an affordable energy storage system. I am aware that Tesla has an EV capable of 300 miles per charge but the current model starts at $101,500, however they have another model scheduled to debut in 2012 for $49,000 (including a $7,500 tax credit). Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas. I just cant see them ever being more than a niche market, until an affordable car comes around with a range similar to comparable ICE vehicles. With an infrastructure that will be able to support them, including charging stations and an improved electrical grid Is the post supportive of tipping wait staff? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the author in favor of school data? yes Shame on you. It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you're sitting on your... laurels. I grew up in Kolkata in the 80s. Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the slums in the central and northern parts of the city. More importantly, she drew attention to the plight of the homeless and dying in the city. I get that this makes some Bengali intellectuals, such as Aroup Chatterjee, uncomfortable. So what? So her priorities didn't agree with yours. Since when did your priorities become the yardstick for sainthood? Is the post against palestinian suffering?  is 1038.

The law isn't going to make a major difference here. It is hard to argue that marijuana should be illegal when alcohol and tobacco, both more harmful substances, are legal and widely promoted. And in your hysterical attempt to portray marijuana as the demon weed you ignore the fact that the arrests and violence that accompany marijuana use and sales do more harm than the drug actually does. I'm concerned about the fact that many kids don't understand that marijuana is harmful. Not only does it lead to demotivation in some, it now appears that it can permanenty lower the IQ of a teenage user by some 9 points. But alcohol also damages the teenage brain. What we need here is education, not prohibition, and a ban on advertising and promotion -- something we should have for alcohol and tobacco as well, but do not. Is the author in favor of violent fanatic? no "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Does the post support machine use? yes Nationalizing the banks would only move them from a bureaucracy that is too big to one that is even larger. If we do nationalize them, at least do it the way we created Government Motors, creating smaller leaner institutions. I would support the Warren-McCain Glass-Steagall Act update. The one issue overlooked in this discussion is the lobbying power of Wall Street bankers that is a roadblock to host of issues from tax reform to their War on the Poor to regulation. Could I suggest that a change in the phraseology from Too Big to Fail to Too Big to Regulate? Is the post supportive of complete privacy child? no Maureen Dowd had a bad trip and so we all supposed to return to the dark ages of marijuana use. I drank a pitcher of Cabo Wabo marguarettas a couple of weeks ago and thought I was going to die the next day. Are we going to prohibit tequila because of my bad trip? I wish! Dang that stuff is good. Too good for amateurs like me. I don't know if bottlers still put the alcohol content on hard liquor, but they used to. It was a handy guide for beginning drinkers.....like college students. But then some people used it as a guide to get as drunk as possible, as fast as possible. You cannot legislate the stupidity out of people and you cannot protect them from every thing. But creating a THC meter and putting it on the package would be very considerate. It probably wouldn't help stupid people like the above mentioned columnist, who just crammed the stuff in her mouth without even doing any research, but it would show a sense of responsibility on the part of the marijuana industry. Does the post support miss america? no How about the quant idea of respect for PATRONS, not attitude and an attempt add hidden fees (a la movie ticket 'service fees')?

"If anyone understands anything about the economics of restaurants they would know that a few tables are the difference between profit and deficit." Is the post supportive of lawyer? yes It's disappointing that the Times would ask a professional bigot to contribute to this discussion. The Cato Institute is funded by people who wish to denigrate and weaken government at every level. If they pay McCluskey's salary, it is because he is carrying their water. Parents who are not content with what their children may or may not be taught in public classrooms have always been free to home school or enroll them in private schools. Public education has been a smashing success story for America and tens of millions of its citizens. However, allowing individual parents to alter lesson plans at will can only result in chaos and a less-educated population. This New Hampshire experiment will end in failure.

I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being.

Is the post against working home? no The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago. Is the author in favor of restaurant? yes I attended a lecture by a PhD psychologist and former prostitute over about 40 years ago. She gave a very detailed account of the dangers faced by woman and made a very logical argument for legalization, and so treatment of sex workers as citizens whose human rights were respected. As the many replies of women in this line of work proves yet again, legalization is the answer. Also the idea represented by the statement "people are not for sale" is a completely naive and objectively false representation of reality. People sell their services and labor for the welfare, and yes, gratification of others all the time! We really need for the USA and its leaders to start acting more like Northern Europeans, in other words like rational adults that live in a world that is supposed to enlightened by reason and compassion, and science and technology. Does the post support george washington? yes College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate. Is the author in favor of government pay benefit? yes This is hardly a 'first generation' problem. For jobs requiring quiet and deep immersion in thought, an open plan can be the kiss of death. Almost thirty years ago temporary removal of cubicle walls in my IT department created chaos. It sometimes takes quite a bit of time to mentally drill down to the core of a problem.

I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension. Does the post support danger? no My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because "there's an American in the room". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes. Does the author dislike sex school? no Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided. Is the author in favor of new york city? no I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese "he could not earn a living (sic!)". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid. Does the author dislike euro zone? yes This is a great statement. After taking Jeffrey Sachs' and Peter Singer's courses online via Coursera for free, it is abundantly clear to me that from the perspectives of economic development, sustainability and ethics all that Mr. Nair concludes is true.

Length of input text Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's "capitalist" system, where "the man" controls how much servers get paid. Is the author in favor of law? yes "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post supportive of tax break homeschooling parent? yes If businesses want highly productive workers they'll start by changing the goals of the HR department from parts replacement to cultivation. Find out what motivates employees to work there: it will be different for each as they are individuals. Next, monitor managers: if they go through staff it must be for a reason. Fix him/her or replace the manager. Second, get rid of the annual review or the promise of an annual bonus. Instead, establish annual awards that allow anyone a chance at a big prize. I've made significant contributions to companies where I've worked and seen my hard work go to some hand-picked politico who did little but criticize me while I did the major lifting. The same with the annual review. Simply offer the worker more if he deserves it and be done with it. If the employee wants a review then let him/her suffer through it. Does the post support adhd? no The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise. Is the post against school budget? no We need a secure country, not just a secure border. We need mandatory use of E-Verify and laws making it illegal to stay in the US without an valid visa and mandate that ICE has to deport. Unemployment, especially among young, is horendous. I do not like it, but I will trade Dream Act for secure country. But I will not give away amnesty without changes going forward. Is the post supportive of thailand 's king? no The statement that this writer makes about "... all the refugees he met showed love and compassion" reminds me of the George Bush statement that "he could see the soul of Putin by looking at his eyes." This writer, well intentioned but so blinded by his own belief system, has to admit that even if 1% of the 1,000,000 'refugees' are radicals or dangerous than that is 1,000 people. Rather than bring in large numbers of refugees, the west should build modern camps in the middle east where these individuals can be protected from war, and when Syria is more stable then they can return home. In addition, why don't the wealthy Arab countries take in these refugees? Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Arab Emigrates. The vetting process is simply not effective, not accurate, and prone to error.

Length of input text My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet. Is the author in favor of invention? no Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012. Is the post supportive of legislation? no The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post against company? yes Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Is the post supportive of royal family? yes One of the most important contributions to US education from TFA alumni has not been mentioned by any of the contributors to this discussion. The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics. Is the post supportive of first lady? yes As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink.

Length of input text What I would like to see is the responsibility for raising children to be the PARENT"S job once again. It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need. I would homeschool but I need to work to pay my school taxes which have quadrupled in the past six years. Social skills learned in school? Seems like I spend every waking moment trying to undo the social skills my daughter is "learning" during school hours! Is the post supportive of nonviolence? no So many have said it so well, I'll just reiterate the key point: Homeschooling is a choice. When one is part of a society, one must participate and contribute for the whole and good of the society. We have long understood that when our children are well educated, the society will benefit. I agree with earlier comments that this is another ultra-conservative gesture to undermine public education and create a culture that rejects facts in favor of religious values, as though one cannot exist with the other. Is the post against home school? yes Is anyone else appalled that we are even debating cutting out school librarians? How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties. Does the post support refugee? no Airline deregulation was driven by the theory of contestable markets. The theory doesn't work when there are no new or potential entrants, which seems to be the case today. Almost unnoticed, however, the Acela has reduced air travel between New York and Washington, DC by half. High-speed rail in other corridors will likely do the same. It is only a matter of time. Still, miserable in-flight conditions should be regulated as matters of health and safety. Minimum pitch (legroom), seat width, and luggage space, perhaps dependent on flight duration, should be considered. Passengers in seats without overhead luggage space (the last two rows in many 737s) should be permitted to check baggage without charge. And seats should be held for passengers who have unavoidably missed connections. Is the author in favor of choice child? no Mossoff is being quite disingenuous. He keeps talking about "identifying, isolating and purifying something." At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about "identifying, isolating and purifying something," that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything. Is the post supportive of cheat? no I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.

Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers. Is the post supportive of immigration issue? no No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights. Is the post supportive of sleep? no My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children of the active PTA parents were receiving all the awards, and maybe some people would find that wrong, replied, "It just proves that parental involvement equals student achievement." When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, "We weren't offered any other options." When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal. Does the author dislike mother teresa? yes Mr. Frank Calzon is equally disqualified in my books, for not holding a reputable, recognizable job in 30 years. His income derives from thousands of articles like this and similar venemous innuendos, divisive fabrications and plain lies, to justify his next pay period. The pain, suffering, blood and deaths that I have seen and endured since 1959 in Cuba, as a result of this unjustifiable. artificial divide, demands better from all of us. If the US could become allied with Germany and the horrors it committed in Buchwand and Treblinka, if Viet Nam has been willing to forgive our henious deeds, Chile have made peace with Pinochet torturers and Nelson Mandela gave the world the greatest lesson in forgiveness, why is it, the US, even with a President, who have seen abuse, segregation and marginalization first hand, continue doing the same and expecting a different outcome in Cuba? Is the author in favor of equal right? yes We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries. TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips.

Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too. Does the author dislike arab? yes MDs are not scientists. Correlation is not causation. I'd rather someone self-medicate with (preferrably legal) Marijuana. Prohibition makes hard drugs seem equivalent and risks making the gateway claims self-fulfilling. Robert Dupont, MD, from wikipedia: He claims that marijuana is "the most dangerous drug",[11] a claim that is at odds with current scientific consensus.[12] He served as a paid consultant for Straight, Incorporated, a "controversial non-profit drug rehabilitation program" for youth that was the subject of numerous allegations of abuse and which was successfully sued for false imprisonment and maltreatment.[13] Is the author in favor of international trade? no I have been secular all of my adulthood. I was a kibbutznik. I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said "God does not hear the prayer of a Jew." Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? "First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever" Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States?

One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us "even to reason better about ethics"---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: "intellectuals" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is "intelligent," then we're pretty damn stupid. Give me a man who can't do algebra but has the integrity to work hard and care for his family, and I'll show you a better kind of human. Is the author in favor of capitalism? yes I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the post supportive of agricultural labor wage? no Conservatives often claim that taxing capital gains is double taxation. This is a fallacy and a myth. People and corporations are taxed only on their earnings. So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits. However, if most of the corporate profits were in the form of capital gains, then it may smarter to take the income as profits (two 15% tax rates results in an effective tax rate of 27.75%).

Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing.

Does the post support public school funding? no Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own. Is the post against asian attitude? yes Marco Saavedra, I wonder about the citizens or legal immigrants who would have received the high school and college scholarships that went to you.

Does the author dislike nation? yes The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk. Is the post against basketball? no Totally agree on difference between perks and policies. To me policies are super important to both my own morale and my actual productivity.

Length of input text When I was in 6th grade, my teacher asked the class to identify the most important thing to learn in school. There were lots of suggestions - reading, math, history, how to write well, spelling, etc. It wasn't until someone said "to learn how to learn" that she was satisfied with the answer. I've never forgotten that lesson. One can quickly gather a lot of information on the internet, and I consider that to be a tremendous advance. But it takes critical thinking skills to turn that information into knowledge, to assess and weigh evidence, to draw well-reasoned conclusions and to present them persuasively. A well constructed research paper assignment can help hone those skills. Does the author dislike interfering middle east? no It might be worth taking a look at the CEGEP system in the province of Quebec. In Quebec, High school ends at grade 11. From there, students enter CEGEP which is either two years for students planning on going to university or three years for those in the technical/vocational side. Those who chose the three year program are ready for work right after graduating from CEGEP. The students who are heading to university have had the chance to take courses more focused on their chosen field. Not everyone can or should go to university and the system CEGEP offers an alternative. Does the author dislike custom? yes One thing that many young women may not realize is just how hard IVF is. I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after a single round. But I was surprised by the toll that fertility treatments took on me personally and professionally. The shear number of clinic visits made the process highly time-consuming, and the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work. So if it feels inconvenient to balance children with work at a younger age, keep in mind that the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are inconvenient and career-impacting in of themselves... and that's all before the baby actually arrives! Does the author dislike right vote? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Is the author in favor of nfl? no Most people rarely if ever eat in the "world's best restaurants." Extrapolating how tipping functions from an expensive midtown Manhattan sushi place to the entire country would be funny if it weren't so insulting to the millions of wait and bar staff who work their butts off at local restaurants in small towns where there's no such thing as "career advancement" especially for those with no more than a high school diploma. You present customers as some sort of victims to the exploitative servers bad behaviors and claim tipping resulting from this is not "capitalism." Yeah, you never see a "successful, ethical corporation[s] under the free-enterprise system" selling people things they don't need or using sex to sell... Does the post support financial aid? no I fear that any attack by the US will be in violation of the laws will leads like the Libyan intervention to move on to regime change. There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change. They don't care that the US is broke and we have lots of problems at home. They have their eyes fixed on getting rid of Assad and they don't care about the US at all.

But deface a Koran and you are called out as an intolerant bigot. This is wrong on the face of it. And at the root is Islam's own intolerance. Strongly criticize their religion and they want to not just protest, but kill you. We need to stand up to this bullying. To the specific issue in this case, yes, fire the worker, if you also fire a worker who burns an America flag during an anti-war rally. Of course we know this wouldn't happen. Is the post supportive of american expat? yes As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation? Does the post support capital? yes Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways). Is the post against tax break taking kid school? no I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains. Is the post against syria? no The usual tripe and nonsense from an apologist for the Arab Terror Method of Political Engagement. When the adults amongst us see arab muslims grant and respect the sovereign rights of others in the middle east, including the kurds, yazidis, azeri, bahai, cop tics, maronites, chaldeans, maneachans, and jews, THEN I might begin to believe that the relentless, mindless commitment to war and violence by arab muslims against all others might be ceased, and there might be peace achieved in the mideast. The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles away from the nearest hostile arab muslim-majority state affirm the general lack of respect that should be granted to the European perspective. Their dictates as to how Israel should be treating a population whose majority supports terrorism against it are wholly meaningless. Bargohouti of course offers the usual bile about Israel and a 2-state solution, and then exposes himself as nothing but a despicable liar by demanding that millions of arab muslims be allowed to move into Israel, despite have no legal foundation to do so. The NYT can do better. Is the author in favor of public beach? yes I like the concept but I have yet to see a reasonable explanation for the added cost of an electric automotive drive train or the multi thousand dollar cost of battery replacement.. Deduct the piston engine, transmission, catalytic converter, liquid fuel system and more from the manufacturing cost. -- Add a 25Hp electric motor, battery charge/engine controller and battery pack to the same body shell. Labor content is about the same as all these components are mostly machine made.

Length of input text These law schools will say and do almost anything to avoid having to reduce the number of law students, which is really the only solution to this whole mess. As an attorney who's taken and passed some of the hardest bar exams in the nation, I will tell you that bar exams are not that hard. If you can't pass them, then you don't deserve to practice. Law schools need to quit whining about the bar and take a long look in the mirror. Either find better students, take fewer of them, or tank your ranking. Either way, blaming the system is just excuse-making. Does the post support check? no The Fed provides discounted money to banks to encourage lending, which will encourage investment, which will encourage jobs, which will encourage spending and more jobs. This process is broken because excess world capacity in labor and off shore productivity is sopping up all of the spending and the banks are putting their investment in risk fee bonds. Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)? This plan encourages saving by U.S. citizens (the kind that breath), retains jobs and spending on U.S. soil, and the increased productive enhancement realized by such projects remain in the U.S.. Does the author dislike fee? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time. Does the post support nonviolence? yes I'm in advertising. A writer and an art director (in the old world) are paired together to come up with creative ideas that neither might arrive at alone. It's an awkward dance between two minds. You have to make a fool of yourself, try out all the bad ideas first, give criticism, accept it. At times it means shouting, singing, cursing, ranting, and speaking every bawdy, politically-incorrect idea that crosses your mind. The process can not be done in public, in an open work area. It's too embarrassing. It involves trust in the person you're collaborating with not to repeat every stupid thing you uttered on the hard road to a good idea. An office needs to be designed based on the kind of work people are doing. Pity to anyone who needs to work on the phone in an open plan. Is the post supportive of health care policy? no If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Does the post support civil right felon? yes Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators. Does the post support classic bayesian inference error?  is 1128.

Length of input text Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use. Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening. Is the post against jail record? yes Not being miserable sets the bar pretty low, so why do so many jobs make people miserable anyway? -------------------------- The thing is that there is no evidence that this is so. If you make workers miserable then they will not be working there for very long. A company cannot prosper doing that. Is the post supportive of internet? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the author in favor of school data? yes Airline deregulation was driven by the theory of contestable markets. The theory doesn't work when there are no new or potential entrants, which seems to be the case today. Almost unnoticed, however, the Acela has reduced air travel between New York and Washington, DC by half. High-speed rail in other corridors will likely do the same. It is only a matter of time. Still, miserable in-flight conditions should be regulated as matters of health and safety. Minimum pitch (legroom), seat width, and luggage space, perhaps dependent on flight duration, should be considered. Passengers in seats without overhead luggage space (the last two rows in many 737s) should be permitted to check baggage without charge. And seats should be held for passengers who have unavoidably missed connections. Is the author in favor of choice child? no Richard Bove told us in March 2008 that the financial crisis was over and that we all should run out an buy bank stocks. So, pardon me if I do not take what he has to say too seriously. He a circus clown that is trotted out from time to time when a reporter needs to find that one remaining individual that still will publicly support the likes of JP Morgan and Goldman. What would be much more revealing is to get an actual player to comment, someone like Tim Geithner, who publicly opposed the TBTF concept, but in behind the scenes devoted his entire tenure at treasury to preserving the TBTF banks.

Is the author in favor of substitute teacher? no Beyond any doubt, it should be. There are those who claim that such training occurs in medical school and at CME following graduation. Under whose auspices? Some Medical Schools have found it necessary to exclude Pharmaceutical Reps and others from access to their students and Residents on their premises. Many of these opioid manufacturers continue to fund various research and teaching projects at these hospitals and universities. It is a system full of conflicts, all of which do not favor the patient. Doctors and other providers continue to end up in court and jail because of intentional involvement in the cycle of drug abuse. Opioid training is an answer but may not be the only one. We may also need to clean up Faculties, test books and the way in which we choose those who enter medical school. Many doctors really feel that they do no wrong.

But I want to raise a different issue. Since when do we owe the bakery clerk a tip? The coffee barista? Every place you go up to a counter, place an order, pick it up yourself, clear your own table--has a tip jar. Should we have tip jars for librarians? Grocery checkers? Shoe sales people? The whole thing is insane. People should work for wages, and employers should pay them. If that means the product costs more, we have a choice about consuming/buying it. PS I had my days as a waitress. So has my daughter. I understand that if you're paid no wages, you depend on tips--and I tip in restaurants. But I don't think it's the right system. Is the post supportive of travel? no I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Is the author in favor of conglomerate get farm aid? no The assumption is that this is a political decision which seems very bizarre to me. An Atlantic spill would affect a heck off a lot more people than would a spill in the Arctic so how does this make sense politically? Last I checked wildlife doesn't vote. I have yet to see a good explanation for this decision, either from a political or an environmental position. If there is one I would like to hear it.

Does the author dislike multiple support method? no I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck.

It was our second child, and the delivery went fine until she started bleeding after the placenta came out. After a few days in the ICU she was fine, but if she had the delivery at home she'd be dead right now. Is there a way to judge the risk of problems before labor? I have no idea. However, if something does happen during labor and delivery it'll happen fast, and wouldn't you rather be in a place that's prepared to deal with emergencies? Does the post support deportation? yes If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world.

Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns.

Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame.

And, Yael, "100% juice" isn't any better than soda. It's all garbage. Does the author dislike walmart? yes In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness? Is the post supportive of justice ginsberg expressing opinion? yes When our kids were little, we made the obligatory trip to Disneyworld, but we coupled that with a trip to the Kennedy Space Center to watch a shuttle launch. We also took them on a driving tour of New England to see things like Mystic Seaport, Plimouth Plantation and Salem. When they got older we took them to the Grand Canyon, Europe and Japan, but they helped plan our vacations and so we made side trips to Meteor Crater and Legoland in Windsor. The kids are now grown and living in different states, but they still ask to take family vacations with us. These trips a good way to reconnect, but it is also clear they have given our kids first hand knowledge and real appreciation of the wider world. Does the author dislike college admission?  is 1074.

Length of input text The Fed provides discounted money to banks to encourage lending, which will encourage investment, which will encourage jobs, which will encourage spending and more jobs. This process is broken because excess world capacity in labor and off shore productivity is sopping up all of the spending and the banks are putting their investment in risk fee bonds. Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)? This plan encourages saving by U.S. citizens (the kind that breath), retains jobs and spending on U.S. soil, and the increased productive enhancement realized by such projects remain in the U.S.. Does the author dislike fee? yes There is a trend towards vastly more violence in the world. A large majority of the victims are the chickens, cows, and pigs held captive by the meat, egg, and dairy industries. Their numbers are increasing greatly, and the violence against them is getting even more severe. Limiting the discussion to just a single species is nonsensical, as all sentient beings have a similar capacity for suffering. The world is on an atrocious path. Eat plants. Start now. Thanks. Does the post support mandatory child? yes It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a "delivery charge" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise "free delivery". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can. Does the author dislike agriculture? yes Sports is big business...Great...Move it out of ALL SCHOOLS and into other plces. I wish our local schools would get out of sports, as we spend mch to much money on a few gifted athletes and almost nothing on our gifted students. Does the author dislike new deal? no The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Is the author in favor of vegetarianism? no This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do.

What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis?

You don't come close to explaining how it's "reasonable" for a parent to second guess the CDC's recommended schedule. Do you have actual evidence that the potential risk of infant vaccines outweighs the risk of the diseases they prevent? It seems not. Does the author dislike convict? yes There are powerful reasons for same sex schools to exist with relevancy just as there is a place for the dominate mixed sex schools. Each type of school bring a unique environment for a student, that can be advantageous to a certain student. Granted that there is so few single sex schools, strong schools with managed financials and endowments can succeed. I am surprised that Sweet Briar did not go coed to save itself or were unwilling to try - there may have been other factors (financial) that did not allow it to do so.

We filed the paperwork, paid for the fees , waited years for visa to be available, countless of trips to UCSIS , and U.S Consular. Years after years of waiting, we can now set foot on U.S head held high as legal immigrants. Meanwhile, illegal immigrants sneak into the U.S , anchor babies, expect to have benefits and free education without paying a penny. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Is is fair of legal immigrants like us ? Dear Mr Saavedra, have you ever been cut in line while you are lining up in a busy restaurant or theme park? That's the same feeling of legal immigrants toward illegal immigrants and freeloaders like you. Does the author dislike scientific patent? yes "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach.

The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. "Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article. Is the post supportive of threat?  is 1032.

A couple of thoughts here, ... according to my prospective jailed employees, in every case the judge has gotten it wrong and they are not guilty. They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks. I really don't know what we can do about this dead weight in society. Are Austrailia and New Zealand still accepting prisoners? Is the post supportive of palestinian state? no No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Is the post supportive of black? yes I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese "he could not earn a living (sic!)". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid.

Is the author in favor of foreign language? no I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains. Is the post against upper middle class young people? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens.

Is the author in favor of college athletics? yes Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Does the post support air fare? no Dear Nina, with all due respect, one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years, without the Western diet posited by you! It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world! Is the post against judiciary? yes "Numerous studies show that between 70 percent and 90 percent of children and women who end up in commercial sex were sexually abused prior to entry." The author seems to imply that if there were no sex workers, all of these people would not have suffered abuse. The problem of abuse came before the activity of prostitution. Abuse leads to prostitution, not the other way around. Banning prostitution will do nothing to prevent abuse, and abuse is the real problem, not commercial sex. I see no valid argument that legalizing prostitution would prevent prior abuse of women and children. It could be bettered argued that if there were legal outlets for sexual urges, cases of abuse would decline. Does the author dislike electric car? yes Easy commentary from an academician. I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been.

Does the post support food label? yes I would have liked to end my second, low-risk pregnancy with a home birth at our home a mile from two hospitals with full maternity wards and neonatal intensive care. This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America. Does the post support language study? no I attended a lecture by a PhD psychologist and former prostitute over about 40 years ago. She gave a very detailed account of the dangers faced by woman and made a very logical argument for legalization, and so treatment of sex workers as citizens whose human rights were respected. As the many replies of women in this line of work proves yet again, legalization is the answer. Also the idea represented by the statement "people are not for sale" is a completely naive and objectively false representation of reality. People sell their services and labor for the welfare, and yes, gratification of others all the time! We really need for the USA and its leaders to start acting more like Northern Europeans, in other words like rational adults that live in a world that is supposed to enlightened by reason and compassion, and science and technology.

Instead, they have to work jobs (while their tax dollars are going to supporting illegal aliens) in order to put themselves through college.

Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier. Doctors deal with people's health all day long and know a lot, but patients and their loved ones are the experts on what is normal for them and are the ones who know when something just doesn't seem right.

In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam.

But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post supportive of growing intelligence? no A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot. Does the author dislike intellectual property? no The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Does the post support patience teaching? no Just wanted to add that I went to a vegan dinner once in CA for people interested in joining the vegan lifestyle. The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules. Is the author in favor of child? no I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program.

Length of input text Thanks for pointing out that it's the affluent kids with correct skin colors got benefits in race-based affirmative action. This is not fair. Colleges should give considerable weight to applicants from financially challenged families regardless of their race. Why should we lower the bar for someone who is welloff but lazy just because of the skid color? The white and Asian kids from poor families also overcome extreme difficulties, their education opportunities shouldn't be taken by kids from affluent families that don't work hard. Does the post support better educated? no I have in, my career, hired two home schooled kids (the ultimate in "parent choice" education). On paper both looked good, and they seemed to know their stuff in the interviews. But both were extremely difficult for other staff to work with, because they were ultimately incapable of seeing other people's viewpoints. One of them literally threw crying hissy fits when she didn't get her way. Now New Hampshire is allowing this kind of head in the sand "la-la-la, not listening, you're view doesn't exist" kind of behavior in the public schools? Remind me to avoid their job applicants. I don't have time to deal with employees who think they have a right to their own facts. Bottom line: you are welcome to give your child a narrow, even bizarre, education if you choose. Just don't ask me to pay for it, or to hire your kid. Is the author in favor of newspaper? no If 1941's liberals thought the way any number of liberals and leftists think today: December 8th, 1941. FDR stands before Congress, asking for a declaration of war against Japan. The ships in Pearl Harbor still spewing smoke. But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns. Is the post against research skill? no Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--"get big or get out"--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture. Does the author dislike child growth? no Yes, quality does matter, but few people either have the time or money to seek out that quality. Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet. I, for one, can't bear the thought of a female pig in a gestation crate for all her adult life. Does the author dislike us national budget? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody.

It's about preventing epidemics from diseases that have in the past have left children deaf, blind, paralyzed, brain damaged. I didn't understand who devastating theses diseases were until I volunteered in another country and witnessed the grief of parents whose children died from preventable diseases. The promotion of vaccines should read "Vaccines. Because it's not all about you" Does the post support condo development? no It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a "delivery charge" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise "free delivery". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can. Does the author dislike agriculture? yes I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support female empowerment? no When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post against europe? no The author's last sentence actually magpies a strong case for women's colleges. CoEd colleges are not generally "...gender-integrated places, where no one is excluded and both sexes learn how to respect, collaborate with and lead each other through shared experience." This is a nice fantasy but it is not reality. I was fortunate to go to an women's college in a curriculum where male students had to come to our turf. So I had the best of both worlds - the opportunity to study with men but in an environment where women's opinions and observations were honored because it was a women's college. PS. Having just finished "I am Charlotte Simmons" by Tom Wolfe, I think we have made the mistake of thinking that age is the equivalent of the emotional maturity necessary to live together and study together in a mutually beneficial way. If anything, we should have more segregation of the sexes through the college years - not less. Is the author in favor of infidelity social medium? yes "when peach baskets were nailed to the railing of the running track at the Springfield, Mass., Teachers College one day in 1891, they were hung at 10 feet -- because that was how high the railing was." A strange argument for never changing the height of the basket. If it was arbitrary to begin with, why should it be treated as the holy grail now?

Is the author in favor of newspaper? no Does a country that produced Sir Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, and Charles Darwin - to name a few - does the U.K. not have enough courage to recognize the monarchy for what it is? A sad, limp remnant of a bygone era? Modern descendants of thugs who engaged in slaughter, rape and pillage before anointing themselves 'kings' deserve no respect or adulation from modern day citizens of the U.K. Even if modern royalty is only nominal and symbolic, their very existence is quite harmful to the notion of an egalitarian, democratic society to which civilized people aspire. It's way past time to put royals out to pasture. Kings and queens belong in story books, and history books. As individuals, they're probably nice people, but the institution of monarchy is quite a different matter. Does the post support passport? yes We need a secure country, not just a secure border. We need mandatory use of E-Verify and laws making it illegal to stay in the US without an valid visa and mandate that ICE has to deport. Unemployment, especially among young, is horendous. I do not like it, but I will trade Dream Act for secure country. But I will not give away amnesty without changes going forward. Is the post against charter schooling? yes I think that Mr. Miller is really burying his head in the sand here, to the point of undermining his own credibility. This seems a prime example of wilful ignorance. It is true that the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME, but it comes awfully close. It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama. Is the post supportive of prostate cancer? yes No doubt about that!! I am a Turkish guy living in the US. I can see both sides of the argument. In my opinion, US has to stay neutral between Persian, Arabs and the Israel to be able to pursue its influence in the region. Right now common belief is US is unconditionally supporting Israel and this is hurting its interest in the Middle East. Remember this: Jews (Israel) and Muslims (Arabs, Iranians...) have been fighting for centuries, nobody can stop that. So, why would you position yourself in the middle of the conflict you know nobody can win. I think the answer is; because strong American Jewish lobby, Middle Eastern Warlords and the US Weapon Manufacturers want that way... Is the post against teacher? no I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.

As a teacher and professor I spent my professional life in it,. And in my college planning practice, I've guided most of my students towards it. But Mr. Hamed is exactly right when he says, "If our goal is to lift students from poverty to high-paying programming jobs, this school's curriculum is admirable." It may or may not produce the next Steve Jobs - we can argue about how geniuses arise some other time - but good vocational education lifts students who otherwise might flounder and founder into jobs that provide them with pride, stability and a good living. I wish more schools did as much. Is the post against happy hour? yes If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the post against subsidizing farm? no This article screams entitlement. After a year, you're an expert? Having been in the trenches of education reform for 25 years before becoming a classroom teacher a few years ago, I can tell you that your youthful arrogance is extremely naive. Whatever talk Washington is talking today will be different than the talk Washington will be talking in a few years. In the meantime, y'all keep flitting in and out of these children's worlds and patting yourselves on the back for making such a difference. I used to admire Teach for America back in the day when it was beginning. It is now populated by such an entitled group of self-serving neophytes who believe only they have THE true answer to the problems of public education that I have lost all respect. Oh, and dear - could you a) list each of the "much easier ways to burnish a resume," and b) look the students and their families in the face when you speak of ",,,hard labor in some of the crummiest classrooms in America?" I'm sure they'd appreciate the reference. Is the post against workplace? no The real gateway drugs are prescribed by doctors. Those are dangerous and we are seeing the fallout from increased heroin addiction and overdose death. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be used too frequently, or used at times when we need to be sober, like during work or before operating a vehicle. And children most definitely should not partake. Alcohol can be just as dangerous as any drug. Even though the majority of citizens do not abuse alcohol, there are some among us who simply cannot drink responsibly. There will be some who cannot use marijuana responsibly either, but I don't think policy should be written for those who abuse a substance. That is not effective policy. Is the post against news column? no I wasn't aware that Justice Ginsburg automatically surrendered her basic Constitutional rights when she joined the Supreme Court, just as I wasn't aware that President Obama automatically surrendered some of his prerogatives during the final year of his second term simply because it is the final year. I keep looking in the Constitution for the relevant Article or Amendment that declares it so, but fail to find it. Perhaps my research techniques are deficient in some way. Perhaps Sen. McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States? Are those better questions for Professor Gillers to ponder than whether Justice Ginsburg spoke out of turn, or whether her desire not to play mute swan in a golf course pond offends tender Republican sensitivities. Is the post supportive of delayed living? no Not only is broken windows policing effective at preventing minor crime, and doing so at far less cost and risk and with lesser punishments, but it contributes strongly to the quality of life, and that shouldn't be underestimated. A boom car isn't as serious as a drive-by killing, but try getting work done on Saturday afternoon when the guy across the street is driving one. We need to prevent major crimes, but we also need to maintain a livable, civil environment in which to live our everyday lives. Does the author dislike accomplish tfa alumnus?  is 1071.

Length of input text Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information. Does the post support justice ginsberg? yes I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike medicine? no Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the post supportive of wait staff? yes If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption. Is the post supportive of volt hybrid another step toward alternative? no Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012. Is the author in favor of farm subsidy? yes It might be worth taking a look at the CEGEP system in the province of Quebec. In Quebec, High school ends at grade 11. From there, students enter CEGEP which is either two years for students planning on going to university or three years for those in the technical/vocational side. Those who chose the three year program are ready for work right after graduating from CEGEP.

Is the author in favor of nfl? no I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Is the author in favor of animal abuse?  is 1225.

Length of input text Human males have strong instincts to select mates with good physical attributes. Women therefore seek to compete. The same phenomenon can be observed in insects, birds, and other mammals. Displays of fitness vary, and in some it is the females rather than the males that make the displays. So -- what is wrong with it? The process is comfortably Darwinian and it has contributed to our success as a species. I don't see why political correctness should be allowed to get in the way of that -- not that, in reality, you could argue men out of their attraction to beautiful women anyway. Is the post against well educated homeschooled child? yes "[T]here were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants." That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a "net employment gain"? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works. Does the author dislike heroin? yes Years ago ultimate was a destination for athletes from a variety of sports looking for something better. Apart from the fun of the sport, spirit of the game attracted athletes away from their roots in more conventional referee based sports. The sport has grown tremendously in the past 20 years and there are now legions of ultimate players the world over--competitive athletes--who identify as ultimate players. They practice hard, they travel to compete, they are committed to the sport through playing, coaching, and leadership. Having represented my university, my hometown, and my country at national and world championships, I am thrilled that American boys and girls now playing for their middle school or high school teams will soon be playing for USA on the greatest stage of all. Ultimate will restore and advance the Olympic spirit. And yes, observers to settle disputes that players cannot themselves immediately settle is the way to go. Is the post supportive of kid home? yes As a psychologist, I would like to point out that while there are certainly abuses with psychiatric drugs, I see the opposite in my practice. Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds. Is the author in favor of u.s? no My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Is the post supportive of student? yes This argument is pure nonsense and NY Times readers deserve better. Migrants coming from the safety of Turkey are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who refuse to come to France because they want to go to Germany are not in search of safer zones.

Length of input text First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Does the author dislike adoption? yes How about safety? So many of the conditions in flying today are just too stressful: getting to the airport 3 hours in advance, packing while trying to take into account banned items because of TSA, limited room because of paying to check bags, the increasingly automated check-in - great when the machines work and you know how to work them, the TSA which is completely crazy and out of hand, the seating in the plane - much much too small and getting smaller, dangers of claustrophobia, plane rage, thrombosis, the fight for overhead storage, the disgusting and very limited meals - difficult to bring your own as security seems to be unreliable as to your being able to keep everything you bring (I had a problem with cheese - granted, if melted it would turn into a liquid but really!) - although important, actually paying for the ticket isn't the most stressful part. Does the post support invention? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support palestinian? no We had the unfortunate experience of having a gambling casino set up shop in our small, but prosperous, resort town. The result was a disaster for the tourist industry. Local citizens were permitted to gamble. Many became hooked on gambling, only to see their lives destroyed. Home values tanked. Divorces went up, along with the occasional suicide. The last thing a local economy needs is one of these outfits. Definitely a very bad idea. They suck the money out of the local economy...to say nothing of the bad social elements they attract. Yikes! Does the post support number? no What we should be looking for are fairer opportunities and more equal outcomes. Race-based admissions are not about outcomes but about a preference. It's revanchist - plain and simple. It's taking away slots from low-income white kids with high aptitude and giving them to middle-income black kids with mediocre aptitude. It's punishing them for something they had nothing to do with. If you can't understand that then you'll never understand the powder-keg of white resentment in red state america. Poor kids deserve a leg up because being poor saddles kids with a whole host of disadvantages that they didn't ask for. To say that rich, black kids deserve a leg up because they're black shows a serious lack of a sense of irony. Is the post supportive of university? yes I was a teaching assistant while in grad school at the University of California nearly 30 years ago and was amazed how many foreign students were in my classes. Some of them had no idea - or desire - how to do the work & whined & confronted me when they got their less than stellar grades. Rich, entitled jerks. Two very wealthy spoiled guys from Saudi Arabia (who hated being taught by a woman) were openly contemptuous of me and one tried to get me fired because I gave him a C. (which was generous of me). I used to wonder why UC was filling so many spaces with these people when it seemed nearly every 18 year old in the state of California was trying to get admitted to UC. I imagine most of them were more deserving than the spoiled foreign students I met. One exception: the students from Iran. I probably taught several dozen of them. Really smart & hardworking. Good attitudes. Thought that was worth saying. Is the post against bank?  is 1129. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text It is ironic that the vaunted "American Business Model" was essentially based on the theft of manufacturing designs and processes invented in Europe during the early years of the Industrial Revolution. We stole that stuff but now that the shoe is on the other foot, the corporate line is "Oh My Goodness, We Need Protection." History laughs at nonsense. Does the author dislike happy hour? yes I agree with Mr. DeLorenzo, range anxiety is a huge issue with EV's. The current technology does not provide an affordable energy storage system. I am aware that Tesla has an EV capable of 300 miles per charge but the current model starts at $101,500, however they have another model scheduled to debut in 2012 for $49,000 (including a $7,500 tax credit). Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas. I just cant see them ever being more than a niche market, until an affordable car comes around with a range similar to comparable ICE vehicles. With an infrastructure that will be able to support them, including charging stations and an improved electrical grid Is the post supportive of tipping wait staff? no No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights. Does the post support sentiment? yes The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise. Is the post against school budget? no What the NJ Transit employee failed to understand is that there is a distinction between free speech rights (burning a Koran, a flag or what have you) and the fact that employment in America is, by and large, at-will -- you can get fired if your boss doesn't like the color of your socks. If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him. Sadly, this particular individual has learned, in the harshest way possible, a rule of Free Speech that many tend to forget in our times: just because you have the right to say whatever you want it doesn't mean that it's always a smart idea to do so. Is the post supportive of yes iran threat? yes That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Does the author dislike prescription opioids?  is 1076.

Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria.

Cuba is a small issue in a big world. but in a nation that prides itself on personal freedom, it is bizarre to restrict my personal right to trade or travel unless we are at or near a state of war - or have a similar national security concern. With Cuba we have no such concern. And unlike many other places in the world, Cubans don't have a knee jerk hatred of us. (So let's instead stop trade with Pakistan!)

When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck.

Reading some of the other opinions in this Room for Debate series shows just how resistant many are to supporting agriculture in the US. So many see no problem with processed foods with an - dare I use the word? - un-natural shelf life. I have watched over the decades as farmers' children wanted other careers. The farms eventually get sold to a developer and the people who buy into the 4-houses-per-acre plat soon start to complain about living next door to a working farm. The zoning changes that result from the complaints further suppress any hope of continuing a family farm. Americans are so unaware of what it takes to bring food to the store modern day, being more concerned about how much food costs or how convenient it is to prepare than the consequences of how it's grown, slaughtered or preserved. Does the post support royal couple? no Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's "capitalist" system, where "the man" controls how much servers get paid. Is the author in favor of law? yes Billionaires think they can get away with anything in stealing public rights, and their lawyers construct arguments in defense of that theft so laughable they would be failed in any law school class they dared present them in. These people have lost touch with the reality of the rest of us in a way comparable to that of any aristocracy in human history. And just like people stood up to the aristocracy in the great European revolutions of the 17th and 18th century, so we have to stand up to the new aristocracy in the 21st.

Then we can put in an airport for the private planes of the rich. Hey, how about a Trump Tower in Yosemite? I'm sure Donald would go for it. Is the author in favor of custom? no The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept.

Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done.

But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain. Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water shortages and no jobs?

They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause "like memory and cognitive impairment"--TEMPORARILY. It's called "being stoned". Does the author dislike american foreign policy? yes This is so incredibly presumptuous and racist. Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class.

How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers.

Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal. Does the author dislike mother teresa? yes Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care. Is the author in favor of public school? no Boy, is this asinine. The commodification of everything, the thimble-witted emphasis on turning everything, including research universities, into a "brand", is precisely the problem. The fact that high-stakes college athletics are in synergy with this larger trend is no recommendation in their favor. As to the idea that "there is no going back", well, that's pretty feeble, too. In 1988 in Moscow I'm sure that most people, including everyone in the Politburo, would have told you that the Soviet system in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe was so firmly ensconced in power that "there's no going back". And had you talked to them three years later? Is the author in favor of unskilled immigrant? yes Discipline is the first thing that any school worth its salt needs to teach. It is most important to teach respect for others, particularly fellow students who are there to learn not to be disrupted and distracted by this sort of thing. Freedom has become a useless trope in our society because we attach no responsibility to it. Long ago when I was attending an excellent public school we students would not have tolerated a person like the one you describe and let me say we were a remarkably tolerant class. Is the post against u.s? yes Amen. It almost seems like the menu is part of a bait and switch operation. That $32 osso bucco is not $32 as printed on the menu, it's $38. Dessert is not $8, it's $9.60. You can do the arithmetic on a bottle of wine. Your $120 check actually runs you $144. God forbid you take the whole family out. Does the author dislike activist?  is 1027. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post against architect? no Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Does the author dislike drone? yes Declawing should absolutely be illegal! It's not just nail removal, it's amputation of the third distal phalanges, or toe bones. It causes severe long lasting stress and pain. It puts the cat walking on its second toe bones, which are not meant to bear the full weight of the cat, causing muscle and tendon damage. It's the number one reason cats turn to biting and pottying outside the box. Many cats wind up in the pound because they were declawed and started biting or going outside the litter box. It's mutilation not convenience. It's cruelty, pure and simple. Is the post against deaf? yes I'm amazed that so many of the comments on this piece seem to be comparing the usefulness of cursive to other forms of handwriting. I think this ignores the larger point, which is that hand-written print is largely dead outside of school. Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or grammatical structure is wasted in my opinion. Today's students are not going to write on the job. They're going to use a computer. And if anything we should be spending *more* time teaching them to use said computer instead of learning how to write things long hand--a skill which they will never use. Is the author in favor of undocumented worker? yes She was a criminal as far as I've ever seen and read. Too bad Christopher Hitchens weren't alive to give us the facts, not his theories about her. But for an institution that gives half hearted apologies, excuses, and outright lies, not to mention legal maneuverings to avoid criminal action, for years involving the sexual abuse of children, then shuffles its biggest criminal Bernard Law to a cushy job in Rome to avoid prosecution. Oh well. If Jesus would behave this way then I guess I know nothing of his life. For Catholics who gleefully go along with this stuff, let's not judge too harshly the extremist Muslims. The Catholics in America practice a craziness that isn't far behind. Does the post support fruit price? no Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Is the author in favor of columbia college?  is 1118.

That sounds great until these "happy" children reach adulthood and don't have marketable or employable skills. They were straight A students but interested in social sciences and have general liberal arts degrees. They loved their classes and enjoyed the ride, but now what??? It is so very competitive out there and when they go for their "group" interview amongst laid off experienced professionals, I find myself wishing I had pushed them to pursue science or math degrees that the news reported were where future jobs would be. My girls dislike technology, they grew up loving "Little House on the Prairie". You can guess how far that's taking them in the "real" world! Is the author in favor of language? no I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Is the post against respect? no Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child. Does the author dislike employer 's choice? no The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew up on them and would increase their profits moderately if they were caught and had to pay modest fines. No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete. Nationalizing banks would make it clearer than ever that the banks were too big to fail (and could engage in even more risky behavior on more profitable terms than their competitors who lacked the too big to fail guarantee). Is the post supportive of home school education? no I imagine that Maureen Dowd's column, written after she ate a whole 420-laced candy car, is the impetus for this Room for Debate. I found that column astonishing. In this day and age of the Internet, for Ms. Dowd not to have educated herself a teeny-tiny bit felt more like behavior contrived to produce a compelling column than behavior in the real world. All I could think of from her column was the old Alka-Seltzer commercial. There are always going to be people who drink to the point of vomiting/hangover their first time out. They learn. And I bet if Ms. Dowd does it again, she won't eat the whole thing. Does the author dislike high school team?  is 1120. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text I attended a lecture by a PhD psychologist and former prostitute over about 40 years ago. She gave a very detailed account of the dangers faced by woman and made a very logical argument for legalization, and so treatment of sex workers as citizens whose human rights were respected. As the many replies of women in this line of work proves yet again, legalization is the answer. Also the idea represented by the statement "people are not for sale" is a completely naive and objectively false representation of reality. People sell their services and labor for the welfare, and yes, gratification of others all the time! We really need for the USA and its leaders to start acting more like Northern Europeans, in other words like rational adults that live in a world that is supposed to enlightened by reason and compassion, and science and technology. Does the post support george washington? yes Republican support Home-Schooling because: -a) Religious freaks likely to be Ultra conserrvative will increase their ranks -b) People who canno't even afford public school, will try to educate their kids themselves which will lead to a nation of analphabetes easily manipulated by Fox, cnn and the like Is the author in favor of medium outlet? yes Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own. Does the author dislike fema? yes "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post against subsidy? no "In a culture that seems to be getting dumber and dumber...." "Seems"? I don't recall people twenty years ago saying that the cure for unwanted pregnancy was to ban contraception. Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our "smart bombs" and "smart phones" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves "by accident" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago. I seriously doubt that even the average person's knowledge of basic geography is better today than that of my grandparents. Is the author in favor of electric car? no Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians.

The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in the worst aspects of market capitalism. In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life. Hands down. Is the post supportive of home schoolers? no The humanity shares the same values regardless of their belifs, whether they are Jews, Christian, or Muslims. Also the differences in belifes do not gives specific group or any Nation rights to occupy another groups or Nation, because they have different values. That is unjust and unfair. it is not democrtic and not ethical. what professor Khalidi has said is completely right and fair, that our country blindly siding Israel for no common interst. Bitting drumer for war with Iran is unjustified. Is the author in favor of consumer behavior? yes Most places I personally have occasion to visit, I note Lations are doing most of the manual labor task. Our family recently built a large home in Austin. As we watched construction all craftsmen including those who constructed a large complicated swimming pool area where all Latino. Both the home in Austin and another in Palm beach Gardens Florida I note, all the garbage collection , yard maintainece, pool service, house cleaning, is all folks of Latino origin. I also understand while I haven't ever seen it, most of our frutis and vegtables are harvested by Lation's, as are our meat and poultry processing plants. What does this tell us? It tells me blacks and white people either wont work for these wages, or won't do that type work. Is the author in favor of college athletics? yes Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible. Does the author dislike food labeling? no My respect for doctors plummets still further with this ignorant, scientific clap trap. Before this doctor opens her mouth she should research not just parrot propaganda Question everything! herd immunity was coined after noticing the if around 65% of the population had had the illness then some population immunity was conferred Was never about vaccination - which is not immunisation btw Check how many of the outbreaks are in vaccinated children ( don't they work) and check the severity ( don;t they work at all?) There is further the danger of causing the disease to be far more severe as the natural immunity of the population disappears ( check what measles did in the South Pacific) And then there is the compromised immune systems due to the injected toxins under the guise of adjuvants You are told that vaccines don't cause SIDS and autism etc etd Well listed as side effects on the vaccine inserts! America has very poor child health and is the most vaccinated country on earth Down around 197 Now go and do some independent research and try to sort out your country Does the post support advocating home birth? no When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces.

Length of input text #1, children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterparts. They are more likely to vote, more likely to get involved in government, and more likely to volunteer for various charitable activities. And, on average, they are better educated. Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school. And, I am the graduate of the esteemed Miami-Dade County Public School system, possibly the most corrupt, crime ridden, drug-infested institution in the country. Is the author in favor of agriculture food industry? no From the 1948 UDHR (Universal Declaration on Human Rights) provision that "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality." international law has grown to accept that forcing someone to give up another citizenship is incongruous with the UDHR. This did not happen overnight. It was not done in the heat of any political movement. It came about because jurists is many nations realised that it was arbitrary to deprive migrants of a second citizenship but not those who acquired it at birth. Discussion of dual nationality is a distraction. In the current situation, there are better laws available: Deny the new Singaporean a visa to the US. Require him to have a "sailing permit" if he does visit and wants to leave. Et cetera. Why does the GOP not discuss those directly applicable laws? And if the Beatles' US income was taxed, why won't the new Singaporeans? Is the author in favor of harm? yes In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Does the author dislike way achieving success? yes Mr. DuPont focuses on the wrong gateway. Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market. Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed. The reason that marijuana was legalized is because it was simply impossible and impractical to continue ineffective and expensive prohibition. It is a practical solution aimed at harm reduction and closing the gateway to other illegal drugs. Is the post supportive of low income education? yes Sorry, don't buy it. Robert L. DuPont profits off of reforming addicts (and their testing), so of course he wants us to believe this rheoretic. I know dozens of people who smoke marijuana, not one heroin addict in that mix. I guess with this logic we can say milk is a gateway to vodka. Is the author in favor of bernie sander? yes College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate. Is the author in favor of government pay benefit?  is 1051.

Is the author in favor of wealth? yes That's hooey. If parents who home school their children are entitled to a tax credit, then what about childless taxpayers who have to pay for public schools? Why shouldn't they receive a refund of the part of property taxes which goes toward local public schools, since they have neither contributed to the costs of operating those schools or derived benefits from them? Both private and home schooling are voluntary, and hence it is a choice that parents make to eschew the public school paid for by their taxes. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay the additional amount for their decisions. If so, then childless taxpayers are entitled to similar benefits. Is the author in favor of forcing lifestyle others? yes As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Does the post support peace middle east? yes "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Is the post against public land? no Should parents be given a shopping list or a line item veto for everything their tax dollars are involved in? Seriously? Procedures & materials for road repair? Medical practices in surgery? Proper chemicals used to treat the town water? We could all have opinions on these but are they professional or informed? Parents do not have a six-year degree and teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design - just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. If individuals are so fearful and filled with anxiety & distrust of modern society, isnt that a private matter for the family and perhaps a mental health professional to deal with vs. these private fears being foisted on the general public who want modern medecine, scholarly education, and sound civic operations to be able to do their best for us. This attitude of "Some of my tax money is involved so I wish to inject my own set of facts and opinions with a red face and a loud voice like I've seen on Fox News" is getting out of hand. Does the author dislike abstinence? yes Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization. Is the post supportive of universal preschool?  is 1163.

Length of input text When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post against europe? no I've never understood why I, the customer, should have to pay the salaries of restaurant employees. They have an employer. I'm not their employer. I'm the customer. Where else but in a restaurant does the customer directly pay the salary of the worker? It's bizarre. In fact, some restaurant employees are the employees of very wealthy employers, who can well afford to pay them, but sit instead somewhere and chuckle at the good fortune of not having to pay their employees but a pittance because the customers, those suckers, are picking up the tab. Is the post supportive of war drug? no We have a woman sitting in federal prison because she refused to abide by the disputed 5-4 ruling of the supreme court. Meanwhile we have entire sanctuary cities in brazen and unrepentant violation of federal immigration laws who suffer zero consequences. Instead they are cheered on by leftist for repudiating and nullifying the federal immigration laws in their communities. Is the post supportive of depression anxiety? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of lowering tax senior 's cd? yes "I've also heard the argument that the pageant experience builds confidence and community among the participants; so does "nerding out" on the debate team or flashing across a lacrosse field. (And you still get to wear a skirt, if that's your thing.)" I find it interesting that you use the term "if that's your thing" here, and support the girls who choose to build confidence and community through an experience other than pageantry. What if participating in pageants is "your thing?" By competing in pageants, I've met some of the most intelligent, hardworking young women in my community. I've gotten involved in my community on multiple levels, not just by promoting my personal platform (Empowering teens to prevent dating violence). And I have gained communication skills that helped me to land a successful job in my career field within weeks of my college graduation. Maybe pageants are "my thing." I don't see a problem with that--only the benefits. Is the author in favor of experience school librarian? yes I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it.

A bond should also be required by individuals claiming religious exemptions. Is the post supportive of living better? no "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the post against jerusalem? yes the top five crops who's farmers get most if not all of the farm aid are mostly conglomerates who don't NEED the aide - but I have no doubt that their executives contribute large amounts of dollars - and their lobbyists also treat Congress quite nicely as well. They spend money to get more money... while the small farmer works and works and works.... Is the author in favor of status teacher? yes They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules. Does the post support capital gain? yes It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a "delivery charge" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise "free delivery". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can. Is the author in favor of obesity? no WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know.

Of course, if Walmart were to eliminate selling meat, dairy, soda, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, candy, junk food, etc., then nobody would shop there.

Does the author dislike industrial agriculture? no In the early 80's and well into the 1990's, I frequently traveled from Paris to New York and back. French friends often supplied me with a list of specific American items 'they absolutely needed' and friends in the U.S. would do the same - asking for their favorite French things...Now, with the internet and globalization in full swing, this practice has completely stopped. Today, most of us *living almost anywhere* can simply order most anything 'foreign' on the web...and, more than likely, can actually find that very same item in a store close to where we live... The streets of Paris and New York are looking very much the same today (very boring)...and we're definitely inching closer to the dreaded one world concept. Real glad I experienced life (and the street) before globalization! Does the post support bad deal city state? no We should establish a Disenfranchised Index that looks, at many things ( examples include): neighborhood, parents (one or two), parent's own education and their income, family stability and environment, family history around employment, public assitance access to opportunityetc) and help those that score lower as early in life as possible. It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment. Does the post support gateway drug? yes I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post against secular democracy? yes Allowing foreign airlines to serve domestic routes is definitely something that doesn't get brought up enough. It's funny how the domestic carriers are all for deregulation and increased competition in theory, but once outside foreign airlines are involved, they rely on what you rightfully point out is antiquated regulation. Fact is that Americans really only have a choice between four airlines for domestic travel and are subject to the whims of these companies. The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such. This means to be required to cooperate with certain regulations. Does the post support blast saddam? no No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level.

All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).

Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?"

The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance.

Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening. Is the author in favor of candidate 's spouse? yes No to tax breaks for private education - it takes public money away from public schools, which need. Furthermore, this will further erode separation of church and state. Finally, the is a conservative scam to take public monies for private benefit. Does the author dislike obesity? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Does the post support bachelor degree? yes So the only other option than the status quo is 1979? I don't buy it. I was on an airline yesterday, there was no room for my 6'3" frame and my client won't cover 1st class. There needs to be minimum seating standards, and there needs to be a trigger to require the airlines to waive baggage fees if TSA lines are longer than 45 minutes. The airlines were quick with their hands out after 9/11, they won't lift a hand now that they are fat and happy. Some regulation sounds good to me. It doesn't mean Communism, it means common sense. Is the post supportive of college administration? yes The real gateway drugs are prescribed by doctors. Those are dangerous and we are seeing the fallout from increased heroin addiction and overdose death. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be used too frequently, or used at times when we need to be sober, like during work or before operating a vehicle. And children most definitely should not partake. Alcohol can be just as dangerous as any drug. Even though the majority of citizens do not abuse alcohol, there are some among us who simply cannot drink responsibly. There will be some who cannot use marijuana responsibly either, but I don't think policy should be written for those who abuse a substance. That is not effective policy. Is the post against news column? no Any intervention is a slippery slope to full involvement which is why we should stay as far away from Syria as possible no matter what they do. Lookt at Libya -- we started out with R2P just to save those Jihadist in Benghazi from Qaddafi. Well it quickly morpher into regime change in violation of the UN SC resolution. So we acted outside the law. We didn't care we are the US - we are not bound by any LAW not even one passed in Congress. And regime change in Libya led to the muder of a US Ambassador -- does anyone think that what is about to happen will end any differently. The President will lie to us as we were lied to about NSA and lied to about US intentions in Libya. In another month we will be bleeding and dying in Syria to remove Assad and install Al Nusra in power -- the so called FSA will either defect to Al Nusra or be buthchered by them. This is a disaster in the making for the US. Is the post against home schooling community?  is 1044. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Making all beaches public, and requiring public access to all beaches WITHOUT the beach-goer having to pay a fee to get to the beach. FOr instance, the NOrthern California coast is spectacular, north of San Francisco. I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden. In my view, we should also prevent people from being able to buy land within a certain distance of the water in areas that remain undeveloped, in order to better preserve these undeveloped areas. Is the author in favor of bully? yes The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Does the post support patience teaching? no I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post supportive of relationship? yes Years ago ultimate was a destination for athletes from a variety of sports looking for something better. Apart from the fun of the sport, spirit of the game attracted athletes away from their roots in more conventional referee based sports. The sport has grown tremendously in the past 20 years and there are now legions of ultimate players the world over--competitive athletes--who identify as ultimate players. They practice hard, they travel to compete, they are committed to the sport through playing, coaching, and leadership. Having represented my university, my hometown, and my country at national and world championships, I am thrilled that American boys and girls now playing for their middle school or high school teams will soon be playing for USA on the greatest stage of all. Ultimate will restore and advance the Olympic spirit. And yes, observers to settle disputes that players cannot themselves immediately settle is the way to go. Is the post supportive of kid home? yes I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of post ww2 higher education? no Evidently the increase in agricultural workers salaries would eat into the growers profits. The opposition of the Farm lobby is indicative of that. Also, where would the replacement workers come from? Maybe some of the readers posting comments in favor of E verify would like to volunteer. And don't forget all the other sectors of the economy where immigrant labor is used. Yes, you can probably attract American workers with Google pay/benefit packages, but the Growers would go out of business due to the costs. And then, when the economy picked up, those workers would immediately move back to the city and we would be back to square one. Is the post against capitalism?  is 1200.

Length of input text As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink. Is the author in favor of omnivore? yes I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the author in favor of american custom? yes Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization. Is the post supportive of universal preschool? no This $18B is widely debunked as all expenses, not the Mexican border, start by subtracting Customs for example, for rational numbers. Besides in an era when we routinely overspend a few Bill per day or hour, what is $18B for border security, and we are turning people away, i say more money for more turnaways. The fantasy that employer sanctions is real, is the fantasy that out underground economy does not exist. To use our favored dug deal motif, if our purchasers of contraband, illegal labor, are the criminals, then the sellers are the greater criminals, sp stop illegal sales, of labor or drugs, at the border first. This employer focus is burden shifting and exonerates the offerors of illegal supplies. as well as being fantasy and employer-bashing. Is the post against land? yes As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Does the post support peace middle east? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept.

It is also disgusting that they are making it so expensive that most people will not be able to take the test. Companies get a lot of federal grants to do this research and that portion should belong to all of us and we should get a break in price. Does the post support obesity surgery? yes Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from doctors who spend 5 minutes with them before moving on to the next patient. I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do? Is the post against exxon? yes What I would like to see is the responsibility for raising children to be the PARENT"S job once again. It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need. I would homeschool but I need to work to pay my school taxes which have quadrupled in the past six years. Social skills learned in school? Seems like I spend every waking moment trying to undo the social skills my daughter is "learning" during school hours! Does the author dislike emigration? no I have been secular all of my adulthood. I was a kibbutznik. I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said "God does not hear the prayer of a Jew." Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? "First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever" Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States? Carter and Obama try to be fair to both sides, and are excoriated for it. Is the author in favor of woman working? yes That's hooey. If parents who home school their children are entitled to a tax credit, then what about childless taxpayers who have to pay for public schools? Why shouldn't they receive a refund of the part of property taxes which goes toward local public schools, since they have neither contributed to the costs of operating those schools or derived benefits from them? Both private and home schooling are voluntary, and hence it is a choice that parents make to eschew the public school paid for by their taxes. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay the additional amount for their decisions. If so, then childless taxpayers are entitled to similar benefits. Does the author dislike land taxation? no I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc. Does the post support walmart?  is 1118.

The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Is the author in favor of vegetarianism? no Brandeis University should be embarrassed to have given a post to someone who employs such specious reasoning. The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false. A mother's decision whether to breastfeed affects only her child's health. Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other children and adults. In our society, parents can perceive that any risks, however minuscule and unproven, outweigh benefits of vaccination only because other individuals have agreed to vaccinate their children and thereby reduce or eliminate risk of a communicable disease in a population. Does the author dislike matter election? yes One need not read any of these articles to know the answer to the question, "should those with beach front homes have to open their land to the public?" because the answer is an emphatic no. Odds are that anyone who owns beach front property so alluring that total strangers would want to indulge in it is probably pretty well off, and in 21st century America nothing is more precious than safeguarding the rights and interests of those who are well off. The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens. Does the author dislike public university? yes In the early 80's and well into the 1990's, I frequently traveled from Paris to New York and back. French friends often supplied me with a list of specific American items 'they absolutely needed' and friends in the U.S. would do the same - asking for their favorite French things...Now, with the internet and globalization in full swing, this practice has completely stopped. Today, most of us *living almost anywhere* can simply order most anything 'foreign' on the web...and, more than likely, can actually find that very same item in a store close to where we live... The streets of Paris and New York are looking very much the same today (very boring)...and we're definitely inching closer to the dreaded one world concept. Real glad I experienced life (and the street) before globalization! Does the post support bad deal city state? no It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that the female ones are much better in this regard) make remarks like "oh yes, we should be doing a better job" of making hospital birth safer, with fewer C-sections and better outcomes -- and less trauma -- for mothers and babies, etc. If they really cared about "doing a better job" they would have been working towards changing the hospital environment and protocols already, and they're not. Very little has changed for the better and in fact c-section rates continue to rise. (And increasingly obstetricians have *less* training now in techniques such as vaginal breech delivery, forceps delivery, VBAC . . .) I'm really not seeing this urge to do "a better job" that they keep talking about. They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real concerns. Also, the attempt by these commentators to equate advocates of homebirth with "anti-vaxxers" and "junk science" is rather scurrilous. The circumstances and practices involved, and the quality of argument and evidence in each case, are not equivalent. Is the post against stronger support public education?  is 1028.

Length of input text The idea that Mr. Adams supports--self-regulation by companies--is deeply flawed. While waiting for the markets to punish companies for bad behavior, many people are harmed. The harm can be both financial and physical. The lag time between the misdeed, the discovery, and the correction can be years. Many of the regulations we have in place are reactions to the failure of individuals and companies to behave in ethical and legal ways. Businesses fumbled away their opportunities for self regulation a long time ago. That said, businesses still have a right to participate in the writing of regulations, as do their customers and other stakeholders. Regulations are, by nature, burdensome. Often the weight of the burden is prompted by the serious nature of the original offense. Is the post supportive of us embargo? no My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children.

When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, "We weren't offered any other options." When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit.

As we watched construction all craftsmen including those who constructed a large complicated swimming pool area where all Latino. Both the home in Austin and another in Palm beach Gardens Florida I note, all the garbage collection , yard maintainece, pool service, house cleaning, is all folks of Latino origin. I also understand while I haven't ever seen it, most of our frutis and vegtables are harvested by Lation's, as are our meat and poultry processing plants. What does this tell us?

In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program.

Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women. We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents. Just ask Honey Boo Boo.

Is the post against employment? no My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Does the post support king george vi? yes I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck. Is the post against private public education? yes I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Is the author in favor of conglomerate get farm aid? no People need sleep. Starting so early so there is enough daylight for a sports programs? That's why today so many of our graduates (?) are only good for sports programs... I am now 63, with 3 degrees from an ivy league school, and having run my own business for over 30 years and having had 100s of employees. I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep. Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally. Public schools shouldn't begin before 9:00 am. Period. Then we'll have better performing students and workers. Guaranteed. And don't tell Is the post against sport program undergraduate school?  is 1033. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text The long list of horrid players that the United States has done business with, (put in place in some instances) is filled with folks so much worse than the Castros. Yeah, they've done bad stuff, and yeah, your families had land and stuff taken away, and people have a tough time. Tell me about China. Tell me about the Saudis. Tell me about Saddam Hussein and the money and weapons we gave him. And Mubarak. And Bin Laden. And the Shah. And Israel. Sorry to break the news to you, but Castro and his story is so B Grade that it no longer merits a response, much less one that has been a total failure. Is the post against privatization? no "Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race." Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to. Is the post against homework? no In 1860, the US Census reports that less than 2% of the census populations owned even one slave. Even in the Deep South, less than 4% of the population owned a slave. And, history shows that amongst the Southern slave owners were Blacks and African Americans. When one considers that most of the wealth generated by the industrial revolution occurred in the slave free North, it's hard to agree with the author's statement that "...much of the wealth enjoyed by" the US was gained through the slave trade. Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US. It would make as much sense for African Americans to seek reparations from the West African kingdoms that captured the slaves and sold them to European slavers. Is the author in favor of affirmative action? yes addition from my last post..find it funny all the people against electric..also all the phony reasons not to go electric..the cost of purchasing and current design NO...only because I KNOW it can be done better. cheaper and use house current..THINK people..all in all who are the looser's with electric.. who is to gain with PLUG stations...who is driving the design--to lock us in.. Is the author in favor of organic chemistry? yes Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets. Does the post support catholic criminality? no Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Is the post against work environment?  is 1055. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text The country is better off having two strong systems of higher education, publicly supported and private. Weakening one (under the unrealistic assumption that the monies fried up will be given to state institutions, and not the state Medicaid or roads program) is not a solution. The solution is what it has always been: wise and forward-thinking state legislators have generously funded public colleges. Does the post support anti vaccination? yes No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Is the post supportive of black? yes The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen. Does the post support war drug? yes My daughter was rejected by four UC schools, and yet, was accepted to NYU, Boston University, North Eastern, George Washington, and University of Maryland. She had a 3.9 GPA, multiple AP courses and 2200 on her SAT. It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University. She is thriving at NYU and she is fortunate that I could afford to send her there. I have been taxes for decades as a resident of California and was denied access to one of the best University systems in the US. Something is wrong with the system. Is the author in favor of war drug? no Veganism is for everyone. The age or body type of a person does not change the fact that all people need vitamins,proteins, and carbohydrates, which can all be obtained from plant sources. Nowadays, almost any grocery store offers vegan choices. There are also separate vitamin supplements available if needed, but most foods can be found with omega-3s, calcium, and zinc already added to them. Juices, along with meat and egg replacements are all healthy, vitamin-rich, vegan options. Helping the environment and gaining health benefits, such as a longer life span and a lower chance of heart disease come from becoming vegan. This article has been widely disputed below from lack of proof and false statements, and for a good reason. The author really should have done more research on the topic. Is the post supportive of farm subsidy? yes The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.

Length of input text I was glad to see some of the opinion-writers acknowledge that we really don't know the effects on individual behavior and population health of changes like the ones WalMart, New York City and others are making in food content, availability, pricing, and information. These changes -- banning trans fats, reducing sodium, posting calorie information -- are made with the best of intentions: to improve individual and population health. But if people simply eat more, or salt food by hand once it disappears from processed food, or drink GatorAde rather than soda, we really won't have made much progress. There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing. Consumer education is great, but forced choice structural interventions would likely do more quickly to move us to a healthy population than consumer education would. Is the post supportive of bayesian inference? yes there has been no evidence , I repeat absolutely no benefit to all the various schemes to frame "let rich keep all their cash" as a sure fired way to get economy going. What is happening is the unannounced side effect of starving the low, middle, and upper middle , which does have a powerful effect, it starves the economy. What is wrong now is lower 90 % do not have disposable income, it has been taxed away food costed away healthcare costed away and stagnated wages away [yes I made some new words]. All that explosive growth of ceo salary is not free money it comes directly from all other emp[loyees. If we force much more onto the wealthy thru tax changes we are unlikely to even get a thankyou before the money is wisked away to tax shelter. The idea that this money would be immediately used to hire is total lunacy, the people saying it most of them anyway know this, but saying it over and over works for some. Does the author dislike classic bayesian inference error? yes I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Is the post against respect? no I admire vegans because they've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work, discipline and attention. I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust. Does the post support vaccination? yes Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post against tax law? yes Private beach, insane. Each morning I get up and walk miles along the beach and the council takes time to look after it. The surf club make sure I am safe when I swim between the flags.

Length of input text I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains. Is the post against upper middle class young people? yes In 1959 or so our family took an epic car trip around New York State and Connecticut. My brother, sister, and I still talk about that trip - good memories. My wife and I always took our kids on vacations. We all had a great time and I hope that their memories of these trips is as fond as ours are. Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. "In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!" Does the author dislike homework? yes The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate. Is the post against public higher education? yes The only concrete definition of royalty I can think of is rule by decree as opposed to rule by consent. Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason. Does the post support racial discrimination? no That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Does the author dislike prescription opioids? yes It's fine for students to discuss these different political dynamics, the world has all sorts of opinions and to constrain political thought is narrow. Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties. As far as voting, surely the Massachusetts Democrat Primary is a great example of how young people, students influenced the primary. The Boston area, Amherst, MA and other heavily populated college towns turned out strongly for Bernie Sanders. That was an extremely close race against a very established, heavily favored Hillary Clinton. Is the author in favor of slavery reparation?  is 1097. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

I have always had at least one paycheck being direct deposited, I have had 2 or three savings accounts, auto loans, and investment accounts. I have always played by their rules, but the interest paid on savings dwindled to next to nothing (.03%) while charges, fees, and penalties have ballooned. The final straw came a couple of weeks ago when a whole new list of fees came out. Not only are they going to charge for paper statements (I went paperless years ago), but they are going to charge for online access!

The people who should really be up in arms are single people and marrieds without children who subsidize families by paying for family services they don't use in the public sector, and the same, like health insurance, in the private sector.

Hopefully, the children of the farm laborers will be educated and find better jobs. The use of imported farm laborers should only be considered a temporary solution. An alternative needs to be sought. This means that a significant amount of money must be allocated to the development of robots to do the picking. Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs. They also may have better ability to detect the ripeness and quality of crops plants. Robots have the advantage of being able to sense light outside of the visible range and to be equipped with ultrasonic and other sensors. One potential benefit of a decrease in defense spending is that some very qualified members of the defense industry could be motivated to work on farm automation.

Bitting drumer for war with Iran is unjustified. Does the author dislike lot money people? no I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.

Length of input text Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones.

Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can. Does the author dislike agriculture? yes In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness? Is the author in favor of news? yes Marriage of William and Kate will work out because of the mother-in-law to be Camilla, who came into the royal family as a divorcee and middle aged. Camilla will have a sensitive feel to their situation and will be the strong defensive wall when pressures will be built up by the royal household on young Kate. Diana's marriage failed since it was a loveless marriage, given Charles' interest elsewhere. Kate and William go into the marriage deeply in love with each other. Does the author dislike economic climate? yes Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly. Is the post supportive of slave trade? no To those who feel wronged by the colonial slave trade: How much money per victim would be enough to satisfy the majority of those who feel affected? Would people of mixed race be given only a percentage of reparations equivalent to their African heritage? Would DNA tests be required for everybody? If the reparations wouldn't be race-based, what records would be used by people to prove that their ancestors were enslaved? Would descendants of white Quakers or poor white people (who were on record in the censuses as being non-slave owners) be required to pay too? Would descendants of white people from the North who fought in the Civil War against slavery have to pay as much as descendants of people from the Confederate states? What about financial accountability from descendants of Africans who are on record in the census as being slave-holders, or descendants of the tribespeople that helped facilitate the slave trade in Africa?

Cuba is a small issue in a big world. but in a nation that prides itself on personal freedom, it is bizarre to restrict my personal right to trade or travel unless we are at or near a state of war - or have a similar national security concern. With Cuba we have no such concern. And unlike many other places in the world, Cubans don't have a knee jerk hatred of us. (So let's instead stop trade with Pakistan!) Is the author in favor of refugee? no The NYT recently ran an article about how people lose the ability to make decisions as it gets later in the afternoon. The example given was that parole boards cease giving parole to prisoners whose cases come up in the afternoon, not because these inmated had worse cases but because , by afternoon, the human brain needs a break and decides not to decide. How does this new research fit into longer school days? Will late afternoon classes be useless? I know at work most people I know, including myself, run out of steam at about 3 p.m. If adults can't keep up to par all day, how are children expected to make decisions all day? Does the author dislike facebook blog? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of tfa? yes I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Does the post support bachelor degree? yes It's nice to think that we can just disengage from the Middle East, but ISIS hate us. If we give them an inch, they'll take a mile and then it'll be a breeding ground for terrorists over there just like Afghanistan was. We have to go after radical Islamists when we have the opportunity. Is the post against freedom? no The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk.

Length of input text Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets. Does the author dislike problem visa? no This article screams entitlement. After a year, you're an expert? Having been in the trenches of education reform for 25 years before becoming a classroom teacher a few years ago, I can tell you that your youthful arrogance is extremely naive. Whatever talk Washington is talking today will be different than the talk Washington will be talking in a few years. In the meantime, y'all keep flitting in and out of these children's worlds and patting yourselves on the back for making such a difference. I used to admire Teach for America back in the day when it was beginning. It is now populated by such an entitled group of self-serving neophytes who believe only they have THE true answer to the problems of public education that I have lost all respect. Oh, and dear - could you a) list each of the "much easier ways to burnish a resume," and b) look the students and their families in the face when you speak of ",,,hard labor in some of the crummiest classrooms in America?"

Does the post support renewable energy? yes I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of post ww2 higher education? no Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other.

What people object to about huge college endowments is the sense they are more about hoarding and bragging rights than providing scholarships. Harvard is holding $30 billion. That money could provide an education to tens of thousands of students at many universities, but instead serves as a line item in the US News ranking of colleges suggesting that Harvard provides a superior education because they have this hoard. States should require these institutions to spend more of their endowments on services or, if they can't, share the money with other colleges or the state.

They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change.

Is the post against marriage? no Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Does the post support volkswagen? no A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot. Does the author dislike intellectual property? no What exactly is the point of preserving the pristine character of beautiful beaches if the only people who can afford to enjoy them are the uberwealthy people who own them? The value of such scarce natural resources is so high that it really shouldn't be affordable for any one person to own them. Because, once a beach leaves the public domain and becomes the private property of one person, the benefits of that beach are the right of that person to enjoy (and charge others for or restrict others from) in perpetuity. In my opinion, beaches all over the country should be declared public property Does the author dislike bank reform? no "The international community will not invest power, prestige and funds to chaperone an artificial "state" Oh yes they will, just as they approved another $5.8 billion to rebuild Gaza. Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a "modern marvel" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza? Is the post supportive of happy hour? no I think Americans are woefully ignorant of the power of Public Health laws here. Everyone should visit a site on Google that will explain the right of officials to remove folks with various infectious diseases from Interstate Transportation, for example.

Length of input text "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post against subsidy? no "reports of fourth graders selling pot edibles at school" Sounds like the parents of those alleged 4th graders need an education in parenting. THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable. Is the author in favor of veganism? yes I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement. On a pain scale from 1-10, I am probably at 12 or 13 all day long. I am 5'3" and weigh 250 pounds. I can walk about 100 feet without my cane and can stand for about 5 minutes. I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being. There are many more out there like me and we should not be judged by appearances. Is the post supportive of bibi netanyahu? no The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post supportive of addiction? no On our farm I frequently employ inmates from the county jail. A couple of thoughts here, ... according to my prospective jailed employees, in every case the judge has gotten it wrong and they are not guilty. They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks.

One could also require businesses that sell alcohol to have breathalyzers and post a sign saying that by entering a customer agreed to a breathalyzer test upon leaving.

There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do.

In raw numbers, there are far more poor whites and poor Asians than poor African American and poor Hispanic students. The data shows low-income white and low-income Asian students have higher high school graduation rates, higher GPAs, and higher test scores than lower- and middle-income African American and Hispanic students. However, ss the authors point out, "If a socioeconomic plan is designed well, it can even achieve greater levels of minority representation than a race-only program." "Well-designed" plans, of course, are "holistic" plans that have enough flexibilty in them to permit admissions officers to rig the admission process in favor of African and American students.

Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.

I believe researching options online helped me to ask better questions and ultimately made me a lot more comfortable with the treatment plan my doctors recommended. In most cases, the information I found online agreed with what the docs were telling me.

That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education? Does the author dislike tax capital gain? yes See the dream as the journal of the soul. See prayer as the personality's half of the dialogue: the kind of prayer when we, sensing a decision that needs to be made, sort the possibilities and make the decision. Meaning it, building that habit. Then the prayer after the decision is made, is, how does my real self, the soul, see this situation? I had a teacher who taught me to dream this way, and I have, for years. And taught it, mostly to meditators. It is transformative. And yes, it leads to lucid dreams, which themselves are rich and helpful and further, make the soul real. And, I want to say of course, lead to lucid living, with a healthy flow of timely decisions, and the solace of a real dialogue with something timeless and universal but wholly inner. Is the post supportive of free market? no Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen. Is the post against state tuition? no I meant: equal treatment/equal protection. To elaborate, that is surely part of the rationale for the IDEA law in the first place, but we shouldn't then go on to debate the meaning of IDEA without contextualizing things according to the underlying issues. Some deaf children (actually, the vast majority of deaf children who are not hard of hearing) will need to be educated primarily through natural sign language. In the US this means American Sign Language--with English as a second language. This is the only way that a truly equal education can be provided, not be pretending that if we just try to maximize integration with hearing children that that will address the issue. Does the post support helping environment? yes "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post against subsidy? no Seems it would be good for the children of folks who have rejected being a part of society to be exposed to the children of normal people no matter how it happens. Being brought up in the paranoid bunker without exposure to the outside world can lead to a warped world view. There were things I did not like about our public schools but the kids will have to swim in the big pond sooner or later. Better they learn to do it sooner. Does the post support depression? yes "It should come as no surprise that the vast majority of heroin users have used marijuana (and many other drugs) not only long before they used heroin but while they are using heroin." It should come as no surprise that the vast majority of heroin users have used milk (and many other dairy products) not only long before they used heroin but while they are using heroin. Therefore, milk and dairy products are a gateway drug to heroin and should be banned. Is the post supportive of social medium? yes The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Is the author in favor of vegetarianism?  is 1025. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text As a school librarian who enjoys working with our local public library system, I think there is a lot to be said for looking at ways for the two to work together more closely to best serve our students, not as a cost-saving measure. Can we deliver better service and aid student achievement by joining up more effectively? But while there is overlap in the goals of public and school libraries, they have a different focus in their staffing and services. In addition, as teachers are asked to do more and more, a school librarian is able to support THEIR training needs and those of students to provide instruction and resources that match their curricular needs. The school librarian provides a fantastic value, reaching every single child and staff member in a school - every program, teacher, administrator, and students of every background and ability are served. Talk about bang for your buck! Is the post against mcmurray? yes If we are that dependent upon the labor of immigrants (and I suspect we are), we should formalize the terms of our mutual interests by expanding the numbers of those allowed into the country to work legally while also enforcing the immigration laws to ensure those quotas are not exceeded. Perhaps we can set up some kind of regional clearing houses through which farmers can submit their anticipated labor needs for the season, which the government will assist in providing vetted immigrant labor from among those registering with it overseas as available for such placement. Again, though, we have no business exploiting foreign labor. If someone is good enough to build America, he is good enough to make his permanent home here and to become one of us. Is the post against banker? yes There are plenty of middlemen who would garner their profits on the increased wages. None would forego their cut -- and the retailer gets the largest share of that. Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects. If more people could employ themselves on farms, we might have a better outcome. But our incentives are not set up to promote that. Correct the incentives. We don't need more factory farms. Is the post against sport subsidy? yes The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups. Does the author dislike intrinsic good? yes I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of war? no Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Does the author dislike drone?  is 1065. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

It is also a scam by some extremist social conservatives to keep women out if the paid labor force. This proposed tax credit should be called what it is--an increase in government spending. Then let the Republicans try to defend it. Is the author in favor of privacy violation? yes Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls "two birds in a nest" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund. The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be "cut out? Is the post against offshore drilling? yes As the son of a farmer, I reluctantly agree with the author's conclusion. Farm subsidies grossly reward a small-percentage of large-scale corporate farms and businesses, which now operate on scales in vast disproportion to the revered Jeffersonian single-farmer business. Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and diesel production/ports; a very nationalist enterprise in an era of which America is the self-proclaimed champion of global free markets and force tariff removals. There are only two kinds of farmers: those selling their land and millionaires...there is little in-between in this industry...which also can no longer survive in a free market...commcercial farming has, in the words of a famous person, become 'too big too be allowed to fail.' Does the author dislike america? no If 1941's liberals thought the way any number of liberals and leftists think today: December 8th, 1941. FDR stands before Congress, asking for a declaration of war against Japan. The ships in Pearl Harbor still spewing smoke. But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns. Is the post against food? no Hollow argument. I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that. Is the author in favor of palestinian? no And what happens if this wondrous one state is not the earthly democratic paradise that the blogger and some posters promise, that 60 years of bitter strife over land, religion, history etc insures that the Arab side, when in the majority, decides to exact revenge for all past wrongs real and imagined? The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying "gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable "land before peace" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves. Does the post support royalty?  is 1029.

Then all the mechanisms in the world for cheating wouldn't matter; just getting caught once would be the end of the corporation. Inventions guarantee that methods will change but the outcome is the outcome. Is the post against affirmative action race? no According to Adam Mossoff: "But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context." But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new "compositions of matter"' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings? Is the author in favor of social medium? yes Marijuana is a gateway drug for frequent use of pizza delivery and the steady consumption of Fritos, Ben & Jerry's, and other junk food. That's about it. I smoked a fair amount of weed in my early 20's, and then the desire just naturally tapered off as I became more involved in professional pursuits. Now that I'm retired, I probably wouldn't buy it even if I could pick it up in the produce section of my local grocery store. Why? Frequent use of pizza delivery, Fritos, Ben & Jerry's...I don't need the help gaining weight and sitting around on my rear end, thank you. Want to know what's a gateway drug for opioid abuse?

Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been.

This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!!

And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt.

THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable. Is the post supportive of technological improvement? no Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also. Does the author dislike public land? yes I am an omnivore who eats a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, eggs and moderate amounts of meat.

However, at my last checkup, I discovered that I am deficient in vitamin D. My doctor recommended I add a supplement. It seems it's hard enough to get all the nutrients one needs for optimal health from an omnivore's diet. The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have always looked unhealthy to me, with sallow skin and dull hair. I knew a vegan who insisted on feeding her baby a vegan diet as well, and that poor child is underweight and I'm afraid to say not very bright. I will not condemn a vegan, however, for his or her dietary choices; I wish that those vegans who do take a self-righteous attitude toward non-vegans would not condemn us for ours.

The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level.

Does the post support obama? yes Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set.

I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Is the author in favor of intellectual? no College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate. Is the author in favor of government pay benefit? yes Having left NYC many years ago, I eventually came to live in a city of 40,000 that through the generosity of a patron secured the talents of the mid 20th century 'starchitects' and prominent firms. Today this small city and its architectural treasures is an international destination for those interested in architecture. Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli. Obviously, none were local. Does the author dislike school librarian? no Israelis would become the minority in a single state, subject to whatever retributions desired by the majority Palestinians. Palestinians would remain second class citizens by virtue of the Israelis having developed both a wealthy economy and having developed and controlled both the modern infrastructure, businesses, and public institutions. The Palestinians would have to be given much of what is in Israeli hands and help them to learn how to manage it and money to support the transition from taxes upon the more well to do (Israelis) to achieve equality in a single state. That's a lot of potential pain and loss for Israelis in a single state. Is the post supportive of foreign student taking us university?  is 1070. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

The final straw came a couple of weeks ago when a whole new list of fees came out. Not only are they going to charge for paper statements (I went paperless years ago), but they are going to charge for online access! And they are going to charge $5/month for savings accounts that don't have automatic deposits going to them. Enough is enough! I am switching to a credit union. Is the post against student? yes Many commentators confuse the results of Reagan's union busting on American labor with the results of undocumented immigration. It was the former that often accelerated the latter, not least in meat and poultry processing. (Globalization also comes into play, but which party pushes hardest on free trade, and who fights minimum wage increases?) So where do the most vulnerable American workers, for whom Republican trolls have been shedding crocodile tears, come down on the issue? According to a March 2013 Pew poll, more than eight-in-ten non-Hispanic blacks (82%) favor letting illegal immigrants stay if they meet certain requirements; about half of blacks (52%) say illegal immigrants should be able to apply for citizenship. Just following the Democratic party line? Well, if the other party is spewing racial and ethnic hatred, do you have much choice? Asian-Americans were more polarized against the Republicans than even Hispanics in 2012. Is the author in favor of open office? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Is the post supportive of student?  is 1046. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text "reports of fourth graders selling pot edibles at school" Sounds like the parents of those alleged 4th graders need an education in parenting. THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable. Is the post supportive of technological improvement? no We should establish a Disenfranchised Index that looks, at many things ( examples include): neighborhood, parents (one or two), parent's own education and their income, family stability and environment, family history around employment, public assitance access to opportunityetc) and help those that score lower as early in life as possible. It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment. Does the post support jail record? no "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post supportive of tax break homeschooling parent? yes I am a health care worker and I have to get a flu shot because it is federally mandated. I have no choice; I have to get the shot. I would get a flu shot anyway but it does not feel good to be forced, it makes me very angry. I strongly believe in immunization and believe people should be encouraged and educated about why immunizations are important but I don't think forcing people is the right answer. I also believe that schools and day care centers should have the right to refuse to accept kids who have not been immunized. Is the post supportive of terrorism? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.

Length of input text Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post supportive of growing intelligence? no The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Does the post support patience teaching? no I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job. He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Is the post supportive of regulation airline fee? yes Too big to fail is just one of the problems in the big banks: there are others, perhaps more troubling, such as "too big to be prosecuted for their crimes", "too wealthy to be told what to do", "too quick to find a loophole to get around any new regulation", "too much political and lobbying power for a corrupt industry to have", "too contemptuous of the law and too interested in their own profit to have scruples about perpetrating massive fraud", "too full of anti-audit strategies to be found out by the auditors until years after the fraud was perpetrated", "too addicted to trading invisible and non-existent money and too contemptuous of actual cash", "too clever for their money laundering schemes to be found out." Is the post supportive of vocational education? yes It can be different elsewhere. The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in the worst aspects of market capitalism. In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life. Hands down. Is the post supportive of home schoolers? no In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran.

Length of input text I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese "he could not earn a living (sic!)". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid. Does the author dislike euro zone? yes as an immigrant in this country and naturalized citizen i favor the concept of multi-citizenship. however, for citizens who are in public office representing a constituent as congress person in federal government, that may cause a conflict of interest when situation arises, such as international conflict. where is their loyalty? Is the author in favor of large farm? yes Criminals should not be allowed to vote. They have no business electing people who make the laws once they have been convicted of breaking the law. Perhaps, if a released offender has gone 5 years without convicting another crime then his voting rights can be restored. But to restore voting rights to newly released convicts is crazy since a fairly high percentage of these people will end up back in prison anyway. We are better off keeping them in jail for longer time periods instead of letting them out to vote. Does the author dislike social service? no Two of the main reasons people switch to cannabis from pharmaceuticals and other drugs such as alcohol: less side-effects and less withdrawal: "Over 41% state that they use cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, 36.1% use cannabis as a substitute for illicit substances, and 67.8% use cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs. The three main reasons cited for cannabis-related substitution are 'less withdrawal' (67.7%), 'fewer side-effects' (60.4%), and 'better symptom management' suggesting that many patients may have already identified cannabis as an effective and potentially safer adjunct or alternative to their prescription drug regimen." [Lucas et al. Cannabis as a substitute for alcohol and other drugs: A dispensary-based survey of substitution effect in Canadian medical cannabis patients. Addiction Research & Theory. 2013] Is the post supportive of farmer? no I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc. Does the post support walmart? yes >> "Many parents will purchase educational materials to use at home to foster a love of learning in their children." That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means.

Later in college I continued my studies in German and took up Russian. As an older adult I took courses in Modern Irish and Old Irish. Now, as a septuagenarian, I am studying Brazilian Portuguese. Why? because learning another language gives you the ability to understand how other people on the planet think. Yes, Cassandra, you need to learn how to think but you also need to understand how other peoples think in order to be a citizen of this world. Does the post support misleading school curriculum? yes It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a "delivery charge" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise "free delivery". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can. Is the author in favor of obesity? no It is quite sad to see a doctor advocate for government coercion for something that every doctor acknowledges has its risks. How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines. Does the post support work? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike medicine? no We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries. TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips. Is the post supportive of waiter tip?  is 1054. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Does the post support export? no When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Does the post support self regulation business? yes great article - as a child of a 'western-parenting style' family who is married to an asian man who grew up with the same chinese-style parenting addressed in her article - I believe that this kind of parenting WILL eventually create independent, thoughtful adults - who have the confidence and skills to succeed in this competitive world. I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children.

Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint.

Any nation wishing to declare independence should meet three essential elements: a strong central government, control of defined territory and security. ". Well we could also start with some basics about the legitimacy of a government to govern people under its control. Without expounding broadly, any basic set of rights would lead to changes in the West Bank and Gaza; and maybe within Israel itself. Israel needs to grant more autonomy, stop creating more settlements, and accept the fact there will be violent acts for decades; let's "get a move on". The status quo is not working. Does the author dislike farm subsidy program? no The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups. Is the post supportive of room debate? no I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us?

During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology. Is the author in favor of global warning? no Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information. Is the post supportive of older parent?  is 1078. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child. Does the author dislike employer 's choice? no I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Does the post support negative impact gambling? no NO CHOICE ! John Stewart Mill defined freedom as all inclusive except when it infringes on that of others. So, if parents decided not to have their children vaccinated... OK. But this choice puts others at risk. It has been said that certain vaccines or combinations of them lead to autistic spectrum disorders based on anecdotal evidence. Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the "false cause and effect fallacy." And in the present case this is what exactly is going on. And there is agreement about this in the medical and scientific community. Students in high school and college who take biology, chemistry, physics... are apt to learn just facts in favor of what the scientific method is all about. Does the author dislike drug? yes Not all who study law want to practice law. They may want to get into business fields where the law degree and some knowledge is helpful. Many students not adept at test taking make wonderful lawyers, not for research perhaps but as litigators. Law Exams in California go for three days and they are very tough but the best top schools have high percentages passing as they take Bar Review courses for a month or so before the actual three day grind. Only graduates from the top law schools with the best grades get the jobs with the giant law firms if that is what you crave you better have passed the bar the first time out. Passing the bar takes hard study and determination. The Law is not a profession for sissies. Is the post supportive of mass arm deal? yes I live in Florida which makes it very difficult to restore civil rights to felons. The laws have become a new form of Jim Crow to prevent minorities from voting. Your chance of becoming a felon is much greater if you are dark of skin hue. Or a different ethnicity than being a WASP. Time to end this persecution of people We need to reform our justice system.. After release all voting rights should be restored . If a non violent conviction even the right to own fire arms should be restored. Does the post support getting full use federal aid?  is 1036. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

I'd be for if my wife and I can get a tax break from school taxes altogether. Since we don't and won't have children the tax break would do wonders for our economic recovery. The whole idea is bogus. The whole idea of home schooling seems egotistically self-indulgent in the first place. If the homeschooling parents aren't happy with the current state of the schools why not become teachers themselves? They obvously think they're more qualified than the professionals presently doing the job. Just because you think you can do a better job than someone else doesn't mean you ACTUALLY can do it better. Does the post support assad? yes Want to vote? Then don't be a felon. Don't want to be in jail? Then don't commit a crime. Want a high-paying job? Then study and work hard. Want free tuition? Then study harder than everyone else and get a scholarship. Want free health care? Then move to Sweden. It's all very simple folks. Does the author dislike kristen semester? no Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Is the author in favor of columbia college? yes I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains. Is the post against upper middle class young people? yes I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too. Does the author dislike arab? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.

As we watched construction all craftsmen including those who constructed a large complicated swimming pool area where all Latino. Both the home in Austin and another in Palm beach Gardens Florida I note, all the garbage collection , yard maintainece, pool service, house cleaning, is all folks of Latino origin. I also understand while I haven't ever seen it, most of our frutis and vegtables are harvested by Lation's, as are our meat and poultry processing plants. What does this tell us? It tells me blacks and white people either wont work for these wages, or won't do that type work. Is the post supportive of big bank? yes Perhaps the workability of an open-office layout has to do with the age of the workers and the type of business. Workers who grew up with eyes pinned to computer screens have been trained -- conditioned -- to tune out the rest of the world. I once watched in awe while a young guy conducted a Skype meeting using two laptops in a crowded, noisy coffeehouse. He was oblivious to the chaos. Internet-focused businesses are staffed with -- and often led by -- just this type of person. Of course people like to have their own offices (status, privacy), but the question is whether having your desk in a communal setting adversly affects one's work production and workplace satisfaction. In some situations I think it does, and in some the communality is enhancing. I am old enough that it bothers me to have someone walk behind me and look over my shoulder at my screen. I need walls. Is the post against electric car range? yes Most conservative economists blithely ignore two central economic facts: negative externalities generated by any given economic activity and opportunity costs. Mr. Cotti gives at least passing notice to the former, but shows no awareness of the latter. How many good, permanent jobs with career ladders could be created by investing in, say, a medical complex, a nursing home, a high-tech construction firm, or a solar panel manufacturing plant? Why not provide incentives to businesses that satisfy basic human needs rather than those that pander to humankind's worst instincts? Does the author dislike woman? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support female empowerment? no We helped create ISIS in Iraq simply by occupying the country and bringing down the strongman that would not let them. We then exploited ISIS in Syria to fight against Assad. At first they fought side by side with the al-Nusra Front (Ayman Zawahiri's men) and both groups blended with the Syrian opposition. That was fine with us as long as they did what we wanted. But ISIS had their own agenda all along, and it excluded al-Nusra and the dumb rebels. Help Assad, who was telling the truth since the start, stay in power, and let Russia and Iran support him then ISIS will be wiped out. That is of course if we are done playing games. Is the post against college library? yes Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post supportive of growing intelligence?  is 1113.

Length of input text I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years. Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects. Does the post support constitutional monarchy? yes The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation. Does the post support electric? no As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation? Does the post support capital? yes I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Is the author in favor of nfl? no I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists.

I don't do well with ANY grains (even white rice leaves me bloated). That means no wheat, no corn, no barley, no quinoa, no oats... Gluten is my enemy. Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas. (On a side note, I had all symptoms of PCOS - then I got surprisingly very pregnant after cleaning up my diet.) Yes, a vegan diet would likely kill me. Probably my baby too. Is the post supportive of school? no This argument is seriously flawed. What are this guy's qualifications? He's a chef, not an evolutionary biologist. Every living thing has evolved with certain traits that have enabled it to thrive. No, we may not have the speed and strength to kill a deer with our bare hands. But we have other evolutionary advantages that have enabled us to eat animals. Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet. If we weren't fit to eat animals we'd be extinct by now. Eating raw meat makes people sick because modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination. It's also the modern industrial diet that has lead to our current health problems (diabetes, heart disease, etc.) If people ate the way they did a hundred years ago and earlier (including eating meat) we'd all be a lot healthier. It's not meat that's the problem. Is the post against homeschool? yes Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Is the post supportive of royal family? yes To say that most teachers look back at their first years of teaching with regrets is an understatement. As a teacher for 22 years, I can attest to the effort it takes to gain competence and mastery. After years of reflection, feedback, more reflection and refinement of techniques, I am proud of the product given to my wonderful middle school math students. And many people would have said I was pretty good 22 years ago. Would you rather use an automobile mechanic who is untested or the tried and true pro? Is the post against homework kid? yes This article is mainly about: (a) The health risks that the entire VEGAN population (both adults and children) face. (b) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGAN diet. (c) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGETARIAN diet. (d) The health risks that the entire VEGETARIAN population (both adults and children) face. The correct answer is (b). Some of these comments make wonder about the commenter's reading comprehension skills. Nina isn't saying that it's unhealthy to raise kids on a VEGETARIAN diet (i.e. one that includes eggs and dairy). Neither is she saying that adults should not be vegan due to health risks. She is saying that it's risky for BABIES AND CHILDREN to be fed a vegan diet. Why are so many people responding to this article with long-winded replies about how they became vegan as ADULTS and are enjoying the health benefits? And why are others citing healthy babies raised on VEGETARIAN food as a rebuttal to this article? What part of this do you not understand?!?! Is the post against teach? yes I think we spend too much time thinking up ways to make life more difficult. I am an American citizen, as are my ancestors for many generations. I was married in Connecticut, and dutifully pay my taxes to the US every year. But because I married a foreign man, we've had to live overseas for two decades now. If you're going to require American citizens regardless of where they live to pay US taxes, but forbid them to live in the US, is it really fair to also forbid us to acquire dual citizenship from more accepting countries?

Is the post supportive of low grade? yes I graduated from a "Seven Sisters" school in 1964 and just attended my 50th reunion. Medical school afterward seemed an anti-intellectual experience and was demeaning towards the few women there. My professional years that followed were far from equal, and although about half of U.S. medical graduates these days are female, income gaps persist. We have a way to go before celebrating full equality. Women make about 20% less than men, and are still mostly the ones directly responsible for child and elder care. We elected a black male president before a female one, and one sitting senator recently advised a female colleague "not to lose too much weight." since he liked his women curvy. Ambitious women are still perceived as "pushy," and continue having trouble with that glass ceiling. We talk too much at corporate meetings and also too little.

Yes, I'd spend four years with smart women again in a heartbeat - an experience that prepared me for the real world. Does the author dislike college team? yes The search for information on the internet about illness and symptoms may not only yield interesting info for the patient, but for the physician as well. I recently had an appointment with my physician and he began our encounter by asking me what I found when I googled my symptoms. I realized that this was brilliant on his part- not only did it give me the opportunity to run by him all of the fears I had concerning my symptoms but it also revealed to him symptoms and concerns I had that I might never have otherwise been raised during a more usual encounter.

As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra."

As much as these refugees are in a really bad situation - people seem to forget that there is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. For different reasons, these immigrants have not integrated into society, refuse to obey local laws and as a group are very hateful and intolerant towards others. You can either call me a racist or a realist - the facts are very hard to ignore. Anyone who thinks that these refugees will be different from those Muslims already in Europe is dreaming - allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text A great article. Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond proving the scientific information in the article to be wrong, it will be very difficult to come to another conclusion than the author arrives at. Vegetarianism and veganism are mainly moralistic choices of life style, and should be presented as such. But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children. Is the post supportive of medical website? no I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause "like memory and cognitive impairment"--TEMPORARILY. It's called "being stoned". Does the author dislike american foreign policy? yes From the 1948 UDHR (Universal Declaration on Human Rights) provision that "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality." international law has grown to accept that forcing someone to give up another citizenship is incongruous with the UDHR. This did not happen overnight. It was not done in the heat of any political movement. It came about because jurists is many nations realised that it was arbitrary to deprive migrants of a second citizenship but not those who acquired it at birth. Discussion of dual nationality is a distraction. In the current situation, there are better laws available: Deny the new Singaporean a visa to the US. Require him to have a "sailing permit" if he does visit and wants to leave. Et cetera. Why does the GOP not discuss those directly applicable laws? And if the Beatles' US income was taxed, why won't the new Singaporeans? Is the author in favor of harm? yes Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, "People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which "has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the "Least Restrictive Environment" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted "inclusion is illusion," that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA. Is the author in favor of tax subsidy non profit? no Aron (#36) is right. Not every part of the educational system here in the U.S. is broken. Only those parts that serve the poor are broken. Mr. Canada's suggestion might well be necessary for the schools he oversees. But most schools don't have the same problems, and for them a longer school day seems unnecessary. To bridge the achievement gap, we need to bring the bottom up. The top is for the most part where it ought to be. Is the post supportive of protecting technology? yes What silly nonsense, reflective of the dogmatic fervor of the acolytes of Saint Market. The essay contains its own refutation: "(B)usinesses are often best equipped to regulate themselves;" but, "(R)ules and their implementation will be dictated by large incumbent firms, like Volkswagen, and wielded against new competitors." And against public health, truth, and syllogistic logic. But wait, a profit is to be made. Is the author in favor of alcohol certain establishment?  is 1072.

Length of input text In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Is the post against american political system? yes I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology. Is the author in favor of global warning? no It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.) Is the author in favor of capital gain tax increase? yes I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc. Does the post support walmart? yes Home schooled young people should be allowed to participate in after-school activities in their home district school, but I fail to see the relevance of the fact that their parents pay local taxes. In most communities a majority of taxpayers have no children in grades 7-12 and thus no participation in after-school activities. Is the author in favor of mandatory college? yes Those who argue to continue the embargo are not sincere. They are representing the families of the rich land owners who fled Cuba after the revolution. They just want their land back, but that is not in the people's best interest...of Cuba or the US. Even today's Communist Cuban government is not as repressive as the rulers they replaced. Does the author dislike bloomberg?  is 1040. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

I live in Vancouver, a short distance from the US-Canada border, supposedly a "friendly' border. It's not friendly at all. The agents inside the building (where anyone who doesn't have a US or Canadian passport has to go) all carry pistols and are dressed in black, even people who are doing typing. I have heard these agents make disparaging comments, based on the appearance of people going into the US. I dread going across this border. I have crossed probably 20 or 30 borders of various countries, including Bulgaria, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia, and so on. None of them were as depressing as the US border. The basic fact behind concerns about border security is, in my opinion, simply xenophobia. Is the author in favor of risk taking? no Completely inaccurate. The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. "Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article. Is the post supportive of threat? no The parenting Amy Chua is selling as Chinese is actually very common everywhere. I've seen many parents pushing their kids hard to take useless piano and violin lessons for reasons more connected with snobbery that the talent of the kid and I've seen people that parents pushed hard to become doctors or lawyers who at some point when they discovered that they are free adults that can make their own choices turned their backs at those careers and often at their parents. This is not Eastern philosophy, just an over controlling parent that is using her power over her kids to achieve goals for herself. Most shocking is her audacity to present her attitude as a way to follow. Is the author in favor of hospital birth? no The chief argument against slave reparations in the United States is that the descendants of Africans transported as slave to the present-day United States are much better off than the descendants of Africans whose ancestors were not enslaved and transported to the United States. Today, the average per-capital income in Sub-Sahara Africa is about $750 a year and the average life expectancy is about 50 years. Africans Americans are by far the world's most affluent large black population. Is the post against feeling safe world? no Undoubtedly, ISIS is a well-organized terrorist organization that aspires to damage the United States in any way possible. The brutal murder of James Foley led some (like Ryan Crocker) to call for increased military strikes in Syria. However, we should not carry out such attacks without considering their impact on Assad's regime. Even an uncoordinated airstrike is likely to damped international pressure against him. It legitimizes his struggle against the rebels and diverts conversations away from his crimes against humanity. We must remember that Assad is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 of his own civilians - sometimes through the use of weapons of mass destruction. As the Syrian leader he had a special obligation to protect the very people he murdered. No one reasonably expects ISIS to carry out attacks on this scale. Military activity in Syria should only occur in the context of a struggle against an authoritarian dictator. Is the author in favor of diet? yes Easy commentary from an academician. I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been. The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand. Does the author dislike palestine?  is 1038.

Length of input text I do agree that there is a downside to globalization when it comes to fashion. I like seeing people from different parts of the world in different styles. But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect. Does the post support retirement account ira 's 401k 's? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post supportive of addiction? no Mr. van Doren utterly disregards the ancillary improvements that will come when electric vehicles become a huge market, and automobile improvements begin to come from the realm of electronics and materials. He assumes, in effect, that the automobile industry will carry over its techological stagnation into a new propulsive means. But this is not true. In the first years of hybrids, many hackers have already gotten Priuses to run as plugins, increased their range, etc. I expect that battery technology will improve, incrementally, at a faster rate than any improvements in gasoline engines, and this disregards breakthroughs. The fact that there is significant commercial interest in electric vehicles at a point where they are marginally competitive is a vigorous and optimistic corner of a struggling economy. Does the author dislike israel violent place? yes Over the years, the Israelis have let us take their heat, committed espionage against, stolen our technology, and kept us in hot water with the Arab World. True the Israelis haven't slaughtered the Palestinians in mass. Instead they let them starve to death slowly, steal their land, and kill only a few innocents at time, which is even less humane. With friends like them we don't need enemies. Regressive Watch Does the author dislike jewish population? no Reviewing recent press articles discussing corruption, bribes, and other nefarious activities to rig the political system, I am struck by how inexpensive our corrupt politicians actually are. Apparently several political leaders were willing to sell their votes and offer their influence for a bribe in the amount of $7,500, other bribes were in the range of $10,000 - $20,000. Don't these fellows have any self-respect? Couldn't they at least hold out for a six figure sum? Yes, corruption in politics is distasteful, and of course, illegal. But who will have any confidence in corrupt politicians who sell themselves so cheaply? Please, people, shouldn't we value our politicians more highly, even the corrupt ones? Is the post against making lifestyle choice? yes True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila! Does the post support living wage?  is 1029. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

She had a 3.9 GPA, multiple AP courses and 2200 on her SAT. It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University. She is thriving at NYU and she is fortunate that I could afford to send her there. I have been taxes for decades as a resident of California and was denied access to one of the best University systems in the US. Something is wrong with the system. Does the post support selling stock? no I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you. Is the author in favor of threat? no I live in a big town on the west coast, the Bay Area. When I go anywhere, people are reading their iphones and handhelds. It's almost comedic. Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other. Social network seems a misnomer. I'd say to a degree these handhelds are an anti-social network. Is the post supportive of privacy? yes I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument.

The value of such scarce natural resources is so high that it really shouldn't be affordable for any one person to own them. Because, once a beach leaves the public domain and becomes the private property of one person, the benefits of that beach are the right of that person to enjoy (and charge others for or restrict others from) in perpetuity. In my opinion, beaches all over the country should be declared public property Does the author dislike bank reform? no great article - as a child of a 'western-parenting style' family who is married to an asian man who grew up with the same chinese-style parenting addressed in her article - I believe that this kind of parenting WILL eventually create independent, thoughtful adults - who have the confidence and skills to succeed in this competitive world. I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it.

Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market. Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed. The reason that marijuana was legalized is because it was simply impossible and impractical to continue ineffective and expensive prohibition. It is a practical solution aimed at harm reduction and closing the gateway to other illegal drugs. Is the post supportive of low income education? yes I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody.

Is the post supportive of middle east? yes How dare the NYT and a group of right wing propaganda; the two nations that are the danger to the world are Israel and the U.S. The U.S has built an empire built on fear; in our domestic politics and well as foreign policy, the focus is always on the danger other nations present, but that is just propaganda for the totally ignorant Americans. How many countries have politicians as stupid as Ted Cruz who advocates carpet bombing a population? Only the U.S. and Israel tolerate such barbarians, and then have mass media such as the NYT commissioned articles to denigrate other nations. Is the author in favor of professional protestors? yes I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.

Length of input text It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented. While there are those who absolutely refuse any vaccinations, they are clearly in the minority. In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good. You don't need a medical degree to think critically about your family's health and to demand answers from vaccine manufacturers who are, frankly, not forthcoming with information. Does the post support first amendment exploitation? yes It does not matter that parents who home school may pay just as much into the school system as other families. People without children pay as well and don't think this authorizes them to use the library or recreational facilities. In addition, supporting a school is not just about paying taxes. Parents who home school because they don't think public schools are good enough for their offspring weaken the very fabric of the public school system and should not seek to benefit from it. If it's not good enough for English and Math, it's not good enough for sports. (Of course, this should not apply to children who are home schooled because of special needs.) Is the post against young people? no The best part of collet age voters is that they have nothing to steal, but feel that they deserve what the old people have worked to earn. Fortunately, we become more conservative as we get older and have contributed something real to the community, otherwise the our party would have run off the rails long ago. Is the post supportive of money corporation? no My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet. Is the author in favor of invention? no "The Center for Financial Services Innovation"...that says it all. Looking for innovative new ways to gouge consumers. I did financial services marketing and advertising for years. And I'm always amazed at the different marketing tactics banks use depending on their target audience. For example, I have a relatively high income, while my sister's is low. We both have mortgages with the same large bank. Both of us pay on time every month. But I'm offered special low refinancing rates with no closing costs via FedEx, and the bank sends someone to my home free of charge at my convenience to close, while my sister gets no offers and in fact they refuse to refinance her house at any rate. I can't even imagine the fabulous offers they make to the truly wealthy. Does the author dislike abusive israeli treatment neighboring palestinian? no I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you.

I have a huge problem with drunken people in public trying to control a moving vehicle. We kill 35,000 people on the roads each year, making terrorism deaths look like a picnic from a public health perspective (though clearly not to those affected.) Perhaps a substantial part of the proceeds from liquor licensing should go to the hiring of additional cops to station in neighborhoods where bars are common. One could also require businesses that sell alcohol to have breathalyzers and post a sign saying that by entering a customer agreed to a breathalyzer test upon leaving. In general, however, what is needed is much greater enforcement of our traffic laws and penalties that have a chance to be effective as a deterrent across the board, including mandatory jail time for a D.U.I. Is the post against mother teresa? no There is no economic argument for taxing income differently, depending on its source; income is income. Such arguments as we typically hear are theological debates, whose partisans hope to pave their way to a personal vision of heaven. The double taxation argument is groundless; in the first case there are many other examples of double taxation, and in the second empirical evidence does not support conservative claims about disincentives. One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it? From a strict economic viewpoint, all income should be taxed equally. This would avoid the huge incentives - and wasted, non-productive investments - in gaming the system, that firms and investors routinely make. The opportunity costs of those activities are literally mind boggling - but never discussed. Is the post against upbringing? yes >> "Many parents will purchase educational materials to use at home to foster a love of learning in their children." That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means. Is the author in favor of jewish population? yes Those who privatize access to our shore lines are the first in line for public assistance when floods and hurricanes damage their private refuge. I live on the Boise River in an area that has kept access open to the public. Just downstream, a fence cuts off access to the river thanks to a handful of homeowners have turned the banks of the river into their private back yard. This would be impossible without the publicly funded Corp of Engineers and other public agencies that control river levels through dams and regulations. Last time the river became a bit unruly, the national guard was called out to move earth and place sandbags to protect these areas. If you receive or need public help, then you need to provide public access. Does the post support monarchy? no I have personal experience in this matter. My son started using drugs when he was in his teens. He got into trouble with the law and served time in prison. When he started to get his life back together he found himself unable to find a job because of his record. This had a devastating effect on his life. He worked in the underground economy which is a sure ticket to trouble. He got off drugs, married and had a son. But he relapsed and lost what little he had gained. Flash forward to the present: last September he was found dead in his apartment of an overdoes of heroin and fentanyl. He had been plagued by depression and self-medicated. Although he had hundred's of friends, and was considered a great person, he couldn't fight the demons alone. He is not blameless but the laws of our land that punished without any hope of rehabilitation certain conspired to keep him down. Is the post against child? no The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups. Does the author dislike beauty gadget?  is 1118.

And the planet will not know it, or even care. Is the post against pay inequality? yes At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason! Is the author in favor of foreign university? yes "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the author in favor of foreign language? no Perhaps the government should start by rating K-12 schools. Identify the myriad failing public schools -- how hard should that be? And then, give these students vouchers to give them a shot at a meaningful K-12 education, Improve K--12 education first, and then worry about the colleges. Does the author dislike immigrant employment? yes The threat to kill college semi-pro sports serves the purpose of forcing the system to curb its excesses. Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult. Does the author dislike military support? yes Hollow argument. I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that.

What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis? Does the post support attack? yes Or farming of this type would just move to mechanization to keep costs down. In the late 70s/early 80s, the United Farm Workers did a lot to prevent academic research into mechanization of California farming, and wanted the state to impose taxes on mechanized fruit and vegetable harvesters. I think their efforts even included a terrorist attack on the Ag-engineering department at UC-Davis (although maybe that's just something I just heard?). But it's 2011, and I doubt they are strong enough to stop mechanization these days. Is the author in favor of attorney? no Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use. Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening. Is the post against jail record? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time. Does the post support nonviolence? yes Golly, have I been transported in time? Malthus still with us? Maybe we could avail ourselves of Mr. Swift's Modest Proposal. All these people are nattering nabobs of negativism. We will adapt as needed and when needed. Scolds are likely to have just as much effect as Malthus. Keep inventing. Continue creating. Some of those who are being created will figure out how to adapt. We should take better care of our planet and its resources and we will.

The embargo has throttled down major trade along the Mississippi affecting trade from New Orleans to Chicago. The lost trade and development is astronomical. We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies.

We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate.

Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women.

Is the author in favor of public school? no Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly. Does the author dislike school finland? yes See the dream as the journal of the soul. See prayer as the personality's half of the dialogue: the kind of prayer when we, sensing a decision that needs to be made, sort the possibilities and make the decision. Meaning it, building that habit. Then the prayer after the decision is made, is, how does my real self, the soul, see this situation? I had a teacher who taught me to dream this way, and I have, for years. And taught it, mostly to meditators. It is transformative. And yes, it leads to lucid dreams, which themselves are rich and helpful and further, make the soul real. And, I want to say of course, lead to lucid living, with a healthy flow of timely decisions, and the solace of a real dialogue with something timeless and universal but wholly inner. Is the post supportive of free market? no I am with Sandra from WA all the way. I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full.

Is the author in favor of child without father? no The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation. Does the post support electric? no No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Is the post supportive of black? yes I would probably die on a vegan diet. I don't do well with ANY grains (even white rice leaves me bloated). That means no wheat, no corn, no barley, no quinoa, no oats... Gluten is my enemy. Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas. (On a side note, I had all symptoms of PCOS - then I got surprisingly very pregnant after cleaning up my diet.) Yes, a vegan diet would likely kill me. Probably my baby too. Is the post supportive of school? no Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also. Does the author dislike public land? yes I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Is the author in favor of conglomerate get farm aid?  is 1266.

Is the post against home schoolers? yes Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post supportive of growing intelligence? no This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards.

Is the post supportive of book? no The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Is the post against public beach access? yes "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the post against jerusalem? yes To reward Bibi Netanyahu for his aggressive and hostile actions by such a move would be criminal.

It is the height of hypocrisy for the US to relentlessly bomb Syria and then slam the door in the face of war-weary Syrian refugees, all while boasting about being an opportunistic, strong and exceptional nation. Americans are yet again showing the world that they are hypocritical, selfish and merciless cowards. I'm surprised our allies haven't slammed the door in our faces yet. I sure would. Is the post supportive of refugee? yes Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care. Is the post against pay inequality? yes How to start re regulating? What's the difference between this now, where the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks, despite public opinion, and the banking S&L crisis when hundreds were prosecuted and jailed? Clinton started the deregulation of banks in the 90s. Lobbying and campaign donations have hugely increased, esp since the 2010 court decision. How can the govt untangle itself from the corporate hold on its powers? It's as if the govt is really regulated by the banks and corporations, rather than the govt regulating the banks. And all in the name of 'free speech' and free private enterprise. And in this bad economy with huge unemployment, the banks threaten more joblessness and recession if they are not left to do as they please. Where's the rebuttal in our main media? The majority of the public is anti big bank and want to break them up. The democracy isn't working. Is the author in favor of admission standard college? yes I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post supportive of relationship? yes i travel in many places in the world where tipping is really just that..Not in the US where it should be called 'wages'. And the restaurants are packed. (see Paris etc). When you get the bill you don't have to factor in TAXES, TIPPING etc. Just because something has been done for years doesn't make it a good thing. Does the author dislike agricultural land owner? no Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's "capitalist" system, where "the man" controls how much servers get paid. Is the post against income tax?  is 1048.

The editorial pointed out that productivity has increased by 72% since the 1970's while pay that has been adjusted for inflation is up only over 8%. The Los Angeles Times points out that independent contractors receive no unemployment insurance or are subject to overtime rules. Union membership now stands at around 6% of the workforce. Any worker who complains on any social media platform is foolish. So yes, telling yourself that you are happy at work does make it easier to go to work.

Migrants coming from the safety of Turkey are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who refuse to come to France because they want to go to Germany are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who bully their way to their desired destination are not in search of safer zones. Please stop trying to shove this argument on readers. Just because you repeat it does not mean it becomes any more believable. Is the post against worker? no Arab League has forbidden Abbas to recognize the Jewish state. Arabs showed clearly that their goal is not a peace, but a destruction of Israel. About what can Israel speak with Arabo-fascists? About a destruction of Israel? Pandering to the Arab aggressors and sacrificing the tiny Israel contradicts the moral values of the West. Does the post support ian adam? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of tfa? yes No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Does the post support obama? yes I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement.

I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being.

Length of input text According to Adam Mossoff: "But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context." But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new "compositions of matter"' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings? Does the author dislike slave reparation? no I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be. Does the post support electric vehicle? no Great article. Arrest should be devoted to people who need social resource. That may mean help, control, or both. It changes people for the better and build trust. People are happier when they know their enforcement of the law is building bridges in communities that may need help. Everyone deserves objective feedback, no one deserves to be abused. Broken windows should be a policy of fixing little things and not draconian punishment for little failures. Cleaning up graffiti, getting kids off the street, and reducing sensational adult advertisement in family communities; those are broken windows. Change can be accomplished mostly by better alternatives and more second chances (learning to do better). Is the author in favor of respect? no The success stories highlighted here seem to be away from the classroom; why is that ? Because the reward system is skewed away from the very very hard work of the great classroom teacher. I understand that the idea is to use these talented few to create more great teachers. This is not a new model, however; the status quo is largely predicated on it. Make classroom teaching as financially rewarding as staff work and you'll get there. Who stands in the door( like a George Wallace) blocking this kind if revolutionary reform? Da Teachers Unions... Is the author in favor of work ethic? no Of course what could go wrong. Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where. Is the post against rehabilitation? no "The international community will not invest power, prestige and funds to chaperone an artificial "state" Oh yes they will, just as they approved another $5.8 billion to rebuild Gaza. Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a "modern marvel" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza?

Length of input text It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.) Is the post against advice? yes The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation. Does the post support electric? no For some. success is achieving things that makes their parents proud of them, and results in others looking up to them. But in some cases this is meeting the expectations of others, not necessarily oneself. People need to have the independence (from their parents) to develop a sense of who they are as individuals. I would argue that a mature individual achieves success when they do things that make them feel good about themselves (for example being a social worker rather than a neurosurgeon) regardless of what others think I am reminded of lyrics from the song Garden Party sung by the late singer Rick Nelson - "you can't please everyone so you've got to please yourself". Is the author in favor of big fail? yes Completely inaccurate. The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. "Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article. Is the post supportive of threat? no Taxes do NOT equal tuition, a point many, many commenters and writers miss. All taxpayers pay for public education, because an educated populace is a benefit for the entire society. Homeschooling parents believe they provide their children a better service than the government can. Great, many can. Those same homeschooling parents get indirect benefits from public education: reduced crime, a better economy, and a more cohesive community. They should support the public schools, just as childless people do. Does the post support miss america pageant? no If pot was a gateway drug, I would have been dead from an overdose 20 years ago. My friends make fun of what a lightweight drinker I am. My New Year's resolution this year was to drink a glass of red wine daily for health purposes. I failed within a week. Don't get me wrong - I am a product of my generation. I've done cocaine (really didn't like) pharmaceuticals (hate) and LSD (loved and hope I get another chance before I die).

However, ss the authors point out, "If a socioeconomic plan is designed well, it can even achieve greater levels of minority representation than a race-only program." "Well-designed" plans, of course, are "holistic" plans that have enough flexibilty in them to permit admissions officers to rig the admission process in favor of African and American students.

I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing.

Is the post supportive of israel? no My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful. Is the author in favor of tax break? no Yes, quality does matter, but few people either have the time or money to seek out that quality. Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet.

But more importantly our store had a manager, a co-manager, an assistant manager, a manager trainees and about 100 employees. And every member of management treated every employee, including me, #100 on the list of 100, with tremendous respect and truly believed that we all have to want to be there in order for us to be productive.

I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also. Is the post against cannabis? no I would probably die on a vegan diet. I don't do well with ANY grains (even white rice leaves me bloated). That means no wheat, no corn, no barley, no quinoa, no oats... Gluten is my enemy. Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas. (On a side note, I had all symptoms of PCOS - then I got surprisingly very pregnant after cleaning up my diet.) Yes, a vegan diet would likely kill me. Probably my baby too.

Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason! Is the author in favor of foreign university? yes If the goal is to secure Taiwan's military capacity then I would have to agree with William Murray's point about providing flexible defensive weaponry. Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal. China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard. Is the post supportive of illegal immigrant legalization? yes The author's last sentence actually magpies a strong case for women's colleges. CoEd colleges are not generally "...gender-integrated places, where no one is excluded and both sexes learn how to respect, collaborate with and lead each other through shared experience." This is a nice fantasy but it is not reality. I was fortunate to go to an women's college in a curriculum where male students had to come to our turf. So I had the best of both worlds - the opportunity to study with men but in an environment where women's opinions and observations were honored because it was a women's college. PS. Having just finished "I am Charlotte Simmons" by Tom Wolfe, I think we have made the mistake of thinking that age is the equivalent of the emotional maturity necessary to live together and study together in a mutually beneficial way. If anything, we should have more segregation of the sexes through the college years - not less. Is the author in favor of infidelity social medium? yes Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of "progress," of quantitative "intelligence," and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for "society." One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us "even to reason better about ethics"---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: "intellectuals" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is "intelligent," then we're pretty damn stupid.

The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided. Is the post supportive of wealthy? yes A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot. Is the post supportive of helping condo developer? yes I am sure Mr. Murray knows what he talks about regarding the capabilities of various weapon systems. The danger is that weapon sales at that scale will change the calculations on each side and may trigger an immediate response from China that the US does not want to face. Also, not only did the US make promise to Taiwan, but also made promise to China. Is the author in favor of airline? no If the goal is to secure Taiwan's military capacity then I would have to agree with William Murray's point about providing flexible defensive weaponry. Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal. China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard. Is the post supportive of airline industry? yes "Why should a family be saddled with the tax costs of paying for public school if they receive no benefit?" - From Ryan above. A well educated public is what leads our country to economic success, medical advancements, and a more evolved society. So perhaps if you home-school and wish to not pay taxes towards education, you should opt out of any benefit given to you that is created as a by-product of public education. Is the post against consumer? yes There is no economic argument for taxing income differently, depending on its source; income is income. Such arguments as we typically hear are theological debates, whose partisans hope to pave their way to a personal vision of heaven. The double taxation argument is groundless; in the first case there are many other examples of double taxation, and in the second empirical evidence does not support conservative claims about disincentives. One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it? From a strict economic viewpoint, all income should be taxed equally. This would avoid the huge incentives - and wasted, non-productive investments - in gaming the system, that firms and investors routinely make. The opportunity costs of those activities are literally mind boggling - but never discussed. Is the post against upbringing?  is 1025. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Hepatitis B? HPV? Be my guest--that choice only affects your family, because those are not diseases your kid can spread at school, on the bus, etc. But no one without a medical exemption should be able to opt out of vaccinations against HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, very dangerous diseases like German measles, pertussis/whooping cough, mumps (which can leave little boys permanently infertile), etc. Measles can live on surfaces like classroom desks and the metal handles people hold in buses for several hours. Nobody has the right to expose complete strangers to devastating diseases that are so easy to prevent. Does the author dislike deportation? no I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Does the post support contemporary western life? no In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness? Is the post supportive of justice ginsberg expressing opinion? yes I would probably die on a vegan diet. I don't do well with ANY grains (even white rice leaves me bloated). That means no wheat, no corn, no barley, no quinoa, no oats... Gluten is my enemy. Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas. (On a side note, I had all symptoms of PCOS - then I got surprisingly very pregnant after cleaning up my diet.) Yes, a vegan diet would likely kill me. Probably my baby too. Is the post supportive of school? no I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Does the author dislike slavery? no Kids already can and do use marijuana. The law isn't going to make a major difference here. It is hard to argue that marijuana should be illegal when alcohol and tobacco, both more harmful substances, are legal and widely promoted. And in your hysterical attempt to portray marijuana as the demon weed you ignore the fact that the arrests and violence that accompany marijuana use and sales do more harm than the drug actually does. I'm concerned about the fact that many kids don't understand that marijuana is harmful. Not only does it lead to demotivation in some, it now appears that it can permanenty lower the IQ of a teenage user by some 9 points. But alcohol also damages the teenage brain. What we need here is education, not prohibition, and a ban on advertising and promotion -- something we should have for alcohol and tobacco as well, but do not.

Length of input text As a psychologist, I would like to point out that while there are certainly abuses with psychiatric drugs, I see the opposite in my practice. Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds. Is the author in favor of bank profit? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of lowering tax senior 's cd? yes "Should the obese person who goes to the doctor only for yearly checkups or the occasional sinus infection pay more in insurance than the one who uses health care at a far higher rate? " Yes, because insurance is a shared risk pool that is based on statistical analysis. If we were to pay for our own conditions, we wouldn't need or have insurance, it would just be a waste of money. Certain lifestyle choices alter risk and it makes sense to put the people who take them in a different statistical category. This is why for example your car insurance rates go up if there's a young driver in the household, and your flood insurance rates go up if you live in a flood-prone area. Does the post support free speech? yes The issue is not whether refugees are good people or not -- rather the concern should be that those fleeing war in Syria should not all be going to Europe. A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants. Nations can and should have workable policies on immigration, capable of being followed and enforced. THis is an issue quite separate from that of terrorism, and one that has been a major political issue in the US for decades already. Is the post against supreme court ruling? yes Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Is the author in favor of columbia college? yes "It is unclear that it has created a populace significantly better informed or intellectually curious." Such a sad but true statement about post-WW2 higher education. I came to this opinion prepared to stomp on it, but find that I agree. In theory. If high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone, everyone, an opportunity to experience learning for its own mind-expanding sake. Big if. Another big if: If French departments continue to exist. How do we assure this when we have no central, unifying vision for our education system? Without that, I'm afraid each institution will be making decisions individually based on the bottom line of immediate utility. Is the post supportive of marijuana?  is 1164.

Hey pal, you're a smart guy, you knew what you were buying!

The idea that you have to have a captive labor force, poor working conditions and starvation wages is born out of greed not need. Big business drives illegal immigration and the transfer of American jobs to China. An increase in the regulation of farming hiring practices, especially corporate farming and a high enough foreign profits tax to make bringing jobs home worthwhile would surely improve the employment numbers. Is the post supportive of proxy war sect tribe within islam? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.

Nobody has the right to expose complete strangers to devastating diseases that are so easy to prevent. Is the post supportive of tax credit? yes It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented. While there are those who absolutely refuse any vaccinations, they are clearly in the minority. In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good. You don't need a medical degree to think critically about your family's health and to demand answers from vaccine manufacturers who are, frankly, not forthcoming with information.

What was once considered to be valuable to intelligence is not exactly the same now. We need to get over this idea of "well, my kids do not even know all the state capitals!" Of course they don't. There is no need to know something off the top of your head in an age when you can look it up instantly.

Is the post supportive of grievance? no As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn.

I use what I consider to be sites backed by real research findings. I never decide I have some condition based on web research - only if what I am feeling means I need a doctor's advice. Often the articles ask other questions and considering the answers means I am more prepared to talk to the doctor if and when I do see her. I think this has served me well. Does the author dislike drug addiction? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post against company? yes Is anyone else appalled that we are even debating cutting out school librarians? How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties. Is the post against airline deregulation? yes The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work. Is the author in favor of single payer? yes Terrorism and immigration have become linked. Western countries welcome legal immigrants based on our tolerance of other religions and cultures. It is ironic that France has accepted countless numbers of Moslems from North Africa and the Mid- East, some of whom turn out, themselves, to be intolerant. No matter what immigrants' backgrounds are, they have to understand that the reason they have been allowed into their host country, in the first place, is that it is tolerant, and that it expects them to be so, too. This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.) Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave. This should include community leaders and anyone who tries to teach/ preach intolerance to others.

Certainly we can decide that some things the public can choose for themselves - unhealthy food, cars that chew up more gas for instance. But do we let the company take our money for a product that is not as advertised? Do we allow truck drivers to drive until they fall asleep at the wheel?

In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job?

This was accompanied by deceptive practices used to maximize the amercable events ergo some of the regulations. Indeed hitting upon fines as a profit center coincided with discovering that gambling with the free money customers provided was more profitable than providing services to customers and the community - like making loans. We all know how that ended. Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans. Does the post support secure country? yes We helped create ISIS in Iraq simply by occupying the country and bringing down the strongman that would not let them. We then exploited ISIS in Syria to fight against Assad. At first they fought side by side with the al-Nusra Front (Ayman Zawahiri's men) and both groups blended with the Syrian opposition. That was fine with us as long as they did what we wanted. But ISIS had their own agenda all along, and it excluded al-Nusra and the dumb rebels. Help Assad, who was telling the truth since the start, stay in power, and let Russia and Iran support him then ISIS will be wiped out. That is of course if we are done playing games.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Does the author dislike war? yes Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Is the post against drone? yes I would agree that fares dropped between the big hubs, but for us who live in the hinterlands and have to drive 2 hours to an airport which is served by a grand total of 2 airlines, not so much. Airfares on the two airlines are always within 10 dollars of each other. The airfare for a 45 minute flight to the hub is about the same as any flight from that hub to any other destination so the end result is flying costs twice as much than if you flew from a hub. The end result is the hub and spoke system results in lower fares where there is competition and a virtual oligopoly at the end of each spoke. Granted, it is not a monopoly which would cause scrutiny, but the airlines collusion acts like one. Add to that, most of the flying public knows what happens with a weather related problem at a hub. The ripple effects throughout the system impact much more than just one hub. Sorry, deregulation resulted in much higher fares and much worse service when weather intervenes. Does the post support maine? no Zionist jews and their supporters were responsible for Palestinian suffering. But the jews have violently determined the fate of Palestinian people and they were and still responsible for their misery and suffering. Palestinian next generations will remember and will never forget or forgive. Does the author dislike deference religion? yes In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Does the author dislike way achieving success? yes "But let's start with the basics. Any nation wishing to declare independence should meet three essential elements: a strong central government, control of defined territory and security. The Palestinian Authority does not yet meet any of them." Historians would strongly disagree with you. Around sometime late eighteenth century some thirteen odd British colonies did "declare independence" without any resemblance of "strong central government" with its territory controlled by the British. Today a certain French foreign minister called it a "hyper-power" and not a "failed state". Please check upon a historian or read up your history. Trust me! It is true!!

And they are angry and tired in their twenties. And in debt. They are not your unreliables. Just watch them. Does the author dislike respect dignity? yes Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Is the post against work environment? yes The threat to kill college semi-pro sports serves the purpose of forcing the system to curb its excesses. Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult.

As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra."

Does the post support constitutional monarchy? yes The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Does the post support patience teaching? no If I send my kids to a private school, in most states, I do not get any form of a tax credit. Yet I still pay taxes to support the public schools. Why should home-schoolers be treated any differently? How will this prevent a bunch of families from having children, giving them the bare minimum of education at home to pass the tests (if testing is implemented), and then receiving a big check in the mail from state? How is this any different from welfare? Is the post against male obstetrician? no Part of the problem, as evidenced here, is that child psychiatrists are not included in the discussion. I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension. Is the author in favor of vacation?  is 1044. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators. Is the post against problem? no Looking at the violence carried out in response to the mere concept of "International Burn a Koran Day" and before that with "Everybody Draw Muhammad Day" and before that with the publication of a few caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish news paper: One could make the argument that the followers of the so-called "Religion of Peace" are so inherently violent as to make any speech which is deemed an insult to Islam tantamount to yelling "fire" in a crowded theater. If we allow ourselves to do this, then what we have essentially said is that constitution is incompatible with world wide Islam. Is the author in favor of workplace? no The actual choice is between global government control of the internet or global business control of the internet. During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law. Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake. Only the US Government's continuing presence at a distance has prevented the net from becoming an international kleptocracy. Only governments are rooted in law. They should govern the internet. Does the post support population control? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support female empowerment? no Arguments such as these frustrate me. When Dr. Evins comes up with a solution to the downsides of keeping marijuana illegal (which any 16-year old in the country can find now without any difficulty whatsoever), not limited to the money flowing to drug cartels, the violence associated with illegal distribution, the racial and ethnic differences in lives lost, ruined and diminished due to disparities in criminal justice processing, (should I go on?), I'll take state control and distribution any day of the week. If she wants to whine about the marketing to children, tell her to go whine to all those free-market Republicans who believe that the markets can do no harm. Maybe they should be required to take the Hippocratic Oath. Does the author dislike reparation? no Dr Gallardo says: "Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples)." Now let's ask what Dr. Gallardo has avoided telling us: "What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost." In most agriculture, land rents, the landowners' profits are the major chunk of full costs. If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down, bearing the brunt of the increased cost of labor. There is no reason fore the land to disappear. There are not that many alternative uses. It's not like farmers, who claim to have built the land with their own two hands, will stop building land. Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich? Why is that a fair policy?

Is the post supportive of freedom speech? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Does the author dislike public school? yes Conservatives often claim that taxing capital gains is double taxation. This is a fallacy and a myth. People and corporations are taxed only on their earnings. So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits. However, if most of the corporate profits were in the form of capital gains, then it may smarter to take the income as profits (two 15% tax rates results in an effective tax rate of 27.75%). Does the author dislike people? yes That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Is the post supportive of arm? no Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post supportive of growing intelligence? no Only problem with students is that they do not vote.

I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that. Is the author in favor of palestinian? no I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus.

Is the author in favor of organic chemistry? yes Mossoff is being quite disingenuous. He keeps talking about "identifying, isolating and purifying something." At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about "identifying, isolating and purifying something," that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything. Is the post against beauty product? no One of the most important contributions to US education from TFA alumni has not been mentioned by any of the contributors to this discussion. The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics.

Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching.

There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change.

The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Does the post support banker lobbying? yes Completely inaccurate. The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. "Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article. Is the post supportive of threat? no Better yet, stop calling them refugees and start calling them for what most of them are: illegal migrants. A spade is a spade is a spade and not a hammer. And start treat them for what they are and apply existing laws. Labelling them refugees is one of the pillars for the hatred between Europeans, who usually take in those who really need help with no questions asked, and those who are on a migration trip into social security systems that have been paid for by those stupid infidels.

Length of input text Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Does the author dislike noncompete clause employment? yes My wife was considered low risk. It was our second child, and the delivery went fine until she started bleeding after the placenta came out. After a few days in the ICU she was fine, but if she had the delivery at home she'd be dead right now. Is there a way to judge the risk of problems before labor? I have no idea. However, if something does happen during labor and delivery it'll happen fast, and wouldn't you rather be in a place that's prepared to deal with emergencies? Does the author dislike factual learning information? yes If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the author in favor of illegals? no Many commentators confuse the results of Reagan's union busting on American labor with the results of undocumented immigration. It was the former that often accelerated the latter, not least in meat and poultry processing. (Globalization also comes into play, but which party pushes hardest on free trade, and who fights minimum wage increases?) So where do the most vulnerable American workers, for whom Republican trolls have been shedding crocodile tears, come down on the issue? According to a March 2013 Pew poll, more than eight-in-ten non-Hispanic blacks (82%) favor letting illegal immigrants stay if they meet certain requirements; about half of blacks (52%) say illegal immigrants should be able to apply for citizenship. Just following the Democratic party line? Well, if the other party is spewing racial and ethnic hatred, do you have much choice? Asian-Americans were more polarized against the Republicans than even Hispanics in 2012. Is the author in favor of open office? yes Where do we go with this? If families who don't believe in public schools can enjoy the athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education period? Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football? Or, for that matter, someone who wants to attend one school but wants to play ball at another? The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, "You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it." If this doesn't disgust you, fine, no one's gonna die. But it is yet another reminder that we will never be a community as long as groups of people don't want any part of a shared effort. Is the post against prostitution? yes Family wealth or lack of it is not a valid indicator of capability for college level academic study and is inappropriate, as is family or personal income, for use by a college or university in deciding whether to offer an applicant admission.

The two decisions are not logically related, and attempting to combine them is certain to lead to poor results. Is the post against refugee europe?  is 1058.

Does the post support law? no In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate. Is the post against financial aid? yes Ms Ramos don't adult women have the right to decide what they do or do not want to do ? Isn't it equally coercive to restrict their freedom ? I also question the realism of your argument. AFAIK, prostitution seems to be a major sector of every known human society, in societys with strict penaltys (even death) and in societys where it is legal Isn't crimminlization like prohibition - something doomed to failure, as banning prostitution is like banning alcohol, or other drugs, perhaps desirable, but doomed to fail because it goes against human nature ? I think you are also confusing social class with prostitution; much prostituion is unpleasant because it is around poverty, just as coal mining is unpleasant. Does the author dislike learn? yes As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Does the post support peace middle east? yes I meant: equal treatment/equal protection. To elaborate, that is surely part of the rationale for the IDEA law in the first place, but we shouldn't then go on to debate the meaning of IDEA without contextualizing things according to the underlying issues. Some deaf children (actually, the vast majority of deaf children who are not hard of hearing) will need to be educated primarily through natural sign language. In the US this means American Sign Language--with English as a second language. This is the only way that a truly equal education can be provided, not be pretending that if we just try to maximize integration with hearing children that that will address the issue. Is the post against cuban population florida? yes My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet. Is the author in favor of invention?  is 1046.

Length of input text I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike bad economy? no No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights. Does the post support sentiment? yes Is anyone else appalled that we are even debating cutting out school librarians? How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties. Does the post support refugee? no How about safety? So many of the conditions in flying today are just too stressful: getting to the airport 3 hours in advance, packing while trying to take into account banned items because of TSA, limited room because of paying to check bags, the increasingly automated check-in - great when the machines work and you know how to work them, the TSA which is completely crazy and out of hand, the seating in the plane - much much too small and getting smaller, dangers of claustrophobia, plane rage, thrombosis, the fight for overhead storage, the disgusting and very limited meals - difficult to bring your own as security seems to be unreliable as to your being able to keep everything you bring (I had a problem with cheese - granted, if melted it would turn into a liquid but really!) - although important, actually paying for the ticket isn't the most stressful part. Does the post support health website? no Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the post supportive of wait staff? yes Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of "progress," of quantitative "intelligence," and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for "society." One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us "even to reason better about ethics"---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: "intellectuals" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is "intelligent," then we're pretty damn stupid.

Is the post supportive of u.k. monarchy? yes When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post against europe? no "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living.

Is the author in favor of pertussis? yes I am an omnivore who eats a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, eggs and moderate amounts of meat. I love cheese and yogurt, milk in my oatmeal, a splash or two of half-and-half in my coffee. I don't bother with sunscreen unless I'm at the beach and get my sun from walking around the city and jogging in Central Park. However, at my last checkup, I discovered that I am deficient in vitamin D. My doctor recommended I add a supplement. It seems it's hard enough to get all the nutrients one needs for optimal health from an omnivore's diet. The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have always looked unhealthy to me, with sallow skin and dull hair. I knew a vegan who insisted on feeding her baby a vegan diet as well, and that poor child is underweight and I'm afraid to say not very bright. I will not condemn a vegan, however, for his or her dietary choices; I wish that those vegans who do take a self-righteous attitude toward non-vegans would not condemn us for ours. Is the post supportive of felon? yes Most of the smartest women I know aren't competing in pageants...and the opportunities these pageants provide in cash for a few women do not undue the harm that they cause for the millions of others that watch. The only 'brainy' thing the women do on stage is anwser a one-line question. Even the volunteering component is still a bit silly. Given that volunteering is now a pre-req for college admissions, these women don't achieve much more than their peers do.

There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children.

It has been said that certain vaccines or combinations of them lead to autistic spectrum disorders based on anecdotal evidence. Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the "false cause and effect fallacy." And in the present case this is what exactly is going on. And there is agreement about this in the medical and scientific community.

I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer.

Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or grammatical structure is wasted in my opinion. Today's students are not going to write on the job. They're going to use a computer. And if anything we should be spending *more* time teaching them to use said computer instead of learning how to write things long hand--a skill which they will never use.

Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense.

The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis? Is the author in favor of sanction? yes Most definitely, I agree that felons should be allowed to vote. Their rights should not even be suspended in my opinion, not for a day. Taking away the right to vote is the ultimate affront in a so-called democracy, and it helps create the downward spiral of criminals in our system. It is just another reason that once a person becomes a felon, they have very little chance of ever succeeded in this country. They'd be much better off leaving the country, however even that right is removed. Criminals are citizens too. This antiquated idea of removing voting rights is akin to the policies you see in North Korean. Is the post against marijuana gateway drug? yes There is no viable evidence that exists that suggest those who are 'rich' are morally above the fray. There is evidence to suggest the contrary via a sense of entitlement and attribution error that may elude others. In any event, Why would they need to be corrupt? They have all the wealth, they have the legal system, they have our system of taxation, they increasingly have control of our judges, they have the lobbyist, they control the politicians, they can buy elections, they run the companies, they enjoy the lowest corporate taxation (effective) rate in history, they enjoy the greatest wealth distribution 'inequality' of any developed nation, they have a work force that works more hours per week than virtually any nation on earth (with less benefits), they enjoy every perk the richest nation on Earth can offer while almost 50% of Americans sit 'at or near poverty'.... What more do 'they' need to corrupt? How much longer will we let them? Is the author in favor of marijuana? yes First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Does the author dislike adoption? yes Whatever the fate of the majority of women's colleges, the best such as Wellesley should survive. Why not have choice. I am unaware of any remaining, highly selective men's colleges, but choice should be preserved for women, especially if they can enroll in courses at nearby co-ed universities that are equally selective. Perhaps among the little Ivies, one or two should have remained all male. I went to a university that from the outset was to be co-ed (ok it took a few years while it raised money for a women's dorm). More than a few of my female contemporaries went on to excel in medical schools, law schools, and graduate school. I never noticed, however, any particular women's point of view in class; just excellence. Does the post support room debate? yes I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space.

I was raised by loving parents who wished me the best and allowed me to explore my desires. I had two Ph.D.'s by the age of 24. I have three children, one a MD-PhD, one a JD, and one a horse farmer. All did as they wished- I told them to do it well- Period. Life is too short for the helicopter parenting I see in my Asian colleagues. Be happy, eat dessert first, life will be over before you know it. Does the author dislike invest? no Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians. Is the post against minimum wage? no Part of the problem, as evidenced here, is that child psychiatrists are not included in the discussion. I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension. Is the author in favor of vacation? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Is the author in favor of nfl? no It's fine for students to discuss these different political dynamics, the world has all sorts of opinions and to constrain political thought is narrow. Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties. As far as voting, surely the Massachusetts Democrat Primary is a great example of how young people, students influenced the primary. The Boston area, Amherst, MA and other heavily populated college towns turned out strongly for Bernie Sanders. That was an extremely close race against a very established, heavily favored Hillary Clinton. Is the post supportive of safer zone? yes I do agree that there is a downside to globalization when it comes to fashion. I like seeing people from different parts of the world in different styles. But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect. Does the post support retirement account ira 's 401k 's?  is 1048. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Does the author dislike slavery? no Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace. Is the post supportive of young people? no Dear Nina, with all due respect, one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years, without the Western diet posited by you! It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world! Is the post against judiciary? yes Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Is the author in favor of property tax? no As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student. If this is Educational theory, we are in deep trouble Does the post support vocational education? no All of my children have been, or are being home schooled through high school. The oldest will be graduating from college this year, the recepient of a few scholarships. Home schooling is not easy, and it is not for everyone. This being said, I have to agree with those who have posted that all of us benefit from the public school system, and must fund it via our taxes. We should demand more of our schools so that our communities' children will get the education that they should to be productive members of society.

Length of input text I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support palestinian? no Of course the YPG have been coordinating with the Russians, so has the United States! Moderate rebels? Seriously? Just because the Rebels opposing the Syrian Democratic Forces are backed by Turkey does that make them moderate? The Kurdish led coalition with Arabs and Syriac-Assyrians want to create a secular democracy within the borders of an autonomous region in a land otherwise ruled by terror. Is that such a bad thing? The whole point of war is to seize territory from those that are trying to kill you. Always has been all ways will. Two years ago the Kurds were almost pushed outside the borders of Syria and faced genocide, they will not let that happen again. I see you are a writer for Ak am Dail which is a Turk Government publication. I was going to take this piece seriously but I think your credentials speak for themselves. Is the post against vaccination? no No doubt about that!! I am a Turkish guy living in the US. I can see both sides of the argument. In my opinion, US has to stay neutral between Persian, Arabs and the Israel to be able to pursue its influence in the region. Right now common belief is US is unconditionally supporting Israel and this is hurting its interest in the Middle East. Remember this: Jews (Israel) and Muslims (Arabs, Iranians...) have been fighting for centuries, nobody can stop that. So, why would you position yourself in the middle of the conflict you know nobody can win. I think the answer is; because strong American Jewish lobby, Middle Eastern Warlords and the US Weapon Manufacturers want that way... Is the post against teacher? no Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways). Is the post against tax break taking kid school? no Having worked at a college library its readily apparent Information Literacy should not be taken for granted and its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school librarians already. There is a strange misapprehension that information is truly just a Google away and students are turning in papers based on Wikipedia entries alone. It will be a very sorry mistake to continue to view librarians as dispensable when they are so desperately needed to navigate the information explosion. As we have more and different types of tsunamis of information, we need more technologically advanced librarians to get us through it. I would also point out that as information is digitized, it falls into the hands of fewer and fewer brokers in a position to control it. The usually forgotten role of the librarian is as a bulwark against that flow of information being in some way hampered or repressed. Does the post support tip jar? no Israelis would become the minority in a single state, subject to whatever retributions desired by the majority Palestinians. Palestinians would remain second class citizens by virtue of the Israelis having developed both a wealthy economy and having developed and controlled both the modern infrastructure, businesses, and public institutions. The Palestinians would have to be given much of what is in Israeli hands and help them to learn how to manage it and money to support the transition from taxes upon the more well to do (Israelis) to achieve equality in a single state. That's a lot of potential pain and loss for Israelis in a single state. Is the post supportive of foreign student taking us university?  is 1042. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: "please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual.

Does the post support taxation? no The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago. Does the author dislike marijuana legalization? yes Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Is the post against work environment? yes I like the concept but I have yet to see a reasonable explanation for the added cost of an electric automotive drive train or the multi thousand dollar cost of battery replacement.. Deduct the piston engine, transmission, catalytic converter, liquid fuel system and more from the manufacturing cost. -- Add a 25Hp electric motor, battery charge/engine controller and battery pack to the same body shell. Labor content is about the same as all these components are mostly machine made. Compare with the Golf Cart / ATV industry -- whether gas or electric, the pricing is very similar.... but electric rules. Does the post support business regulation? no I had an intervention-free hospital birth with my first daughter and a home water birth with my second daughter. Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births. Does the post support export? no Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Does the post support volkswagen?  is 1088.

Length of input text According to Adam Mossoff: "But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context." But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new "compositions of matter"' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings? Is the author in favor of social medium? yes As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink. Is the author in favor of omnivore? yes Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--"get big or get out"--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture. Is the post supportive of u.s? yes I am a native born American. However, because my grandparents were born in Ireland I can apply for Irish citizenship through my mother. I have not done so but see no big deal in it, it would be more for sentimental purposes in my case. I love America but I have deep affection for Ireland. Having more than one passport does not mean a person does not love America, many naturalized citizens are more patriotic than native born ones. So while I see no big deal with Bachmann getting dual citizenship in general, due to her position and her constant patriotic drumbeating, it was rather myopic of her to do so at this time. By the way, I am a conservative person so this is not based on political bias, just honest observation. Is the post against paper money? yes It might be worth taking a look at the CEGEP system in the province of Quebec. In Quebec, High school ends at grade 11. From there, students enter CEGEP which is either two years for students planning on going to university or three years for those in the technical/vocational side. Those who chose the three year program are ready for work right after graduating from CEGEP. The students who are heading to university have had the chance to take courses more focused on their chosen field. Not everyone can or should go to university and the system CEGEP offers an alternative.

But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain.

Is the post supportive of immigration muslim? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Is the post against art event? yes Hollow argument. I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that.

Parents do not have a six-year degree and teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design - just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. If individuals are so fearful and filled with anxiety & distrust of modern society, isnt that a private matter for the family and perhaps a mental health professional to deal with vs. these private fears being foisted on the general public who want modern medecine, scholarly education, and sound civic operations to be able to do their best for us.

Length of input text I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Does the post support bachelor degree? yes I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: "please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone." Does the post support taxation? no My first job back in the 1970s was minimum wage. I worked in the evenings Monday through Saturday unloading trucks and stocking shelves at a now defunct chain store similar to a Target. The schedule kept me out of trouble. But more importantly our store had a manager, a co-manager, an assistant manager, a manager trainees and about 100 employees. And every member of management treated every employee, including me, #100 on the list of 100, with tremendous respect and truly believed that we all have to want to be there in order for us to be productive. Did I mention the store is now defunct? It seems that such wonderful management practices, that formed me as a young adult and which I have attempted to carry on today, are just not sufficiently profitable. Is the author in favor of felon? yes My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Does the post support king george vi? yes I am against burning books, but being born with the Jester's gene makes me want to poke pomposity in the caboose. Also, when people get upset and afraid of things that can't really hurt them (like riding in an elevator) it is good for them to face their fears and see that nothing terrible happens. So what if one were to burn a Kindle that contained a copy of every religion's special literature? That way, maybe, we could all see that these relics are not where God's love lies; and destroy an insidious device in the bargain. Does the post support peak oil? no If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir. Is the author in favor of radical islamist?  is 1153.

Length of input text Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, "People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which "has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the "Least Restrictive Environment" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted "inclusion is illusion," that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA. Is the author in favor of tax subsidy non profit? no As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Is the post supportive of making public education optimizable student? yes The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely. Is the author in favor of internet way? yes Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Is the author in favor of property tax? no NO. Absolutely NOT. If a parent (a *qualified* parent) wishes to homeschool their children it should be at their expense, sam eas any private school. They do not have the right to financially undermine the public school system. Homeowners without children pay school taxes too, while never utilizing the system. Is the author in favor of heroin? no I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program.

Length of input text It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.) Is the post against advice? yes Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts.

Is the post supportive of casino? no Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those who send their kids to private or parochial schools. There is no difference. All of these individuals are opting out of the publicly provided education which shapes our society. The purpose of public schools is not only to educate all children, but to create an educated citizenry that will serve our country well, with the shared values of our American society. Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school, or keep them home - are making a choice with their discretionary dollars. Is the post supportive of funding public school? no Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly. Is the post supportive of slave trade? no The mandate of private corporations is to make a profit. And if the profit is made at the EXPENSE of the society that allow the corporation to exist, well, too bad. Oil companies foul the environment. Financial companies drive the economy into the Great Recession. Airlines have no regard for the people they transport. As long as they make a profit, they are allowed to abuse the public until they are stopped. That is the way it has been since Swift and Armour canned and sold rotten meat and Carnegie sent Pinkertons to shoot striking miners.

Length of input text The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise. Is the post against school budget? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike medicine? no Necessity is the mother of all invention. Never bet against human ingenuity, especially when survival is on the line. The technology we need to move beyond fossil fuels exist today - wind, solar, efficiency improvements like LED lighting, and especially nuclear power. I can't imagine what technology we will have in 50 years - carbon sequestration, fusion reactors, space elevators, orbital solar platforms - there is no point even guessing, but I am very sure technology continues to outpace population growth, and we continue to solve problems faster than we create them. We might be slow on global warming, but science and engineering are key to survival. As Issac Asimov said, "I chose solution, I chose technology" Is the post against slave reparation? yes I imagine that Maureen Dowd's column, written after she ate a whole 420-laced candy car, is the impetus for this Room for Debate. I found that column astonishing. In this day and age of the Internet, for Ms. Dowd not to have educated herself a teeny-tiny bit felt more like behavior contrived to produce a compelling column than behavior in the real world. All I could think of from her column was the old Alka-Seltzer commercial. There are always going to be people who drink to the point of vomiting/hangover their first time out. They learn. And I bet if Ms. Dowd does it again, she won't eat the whole thing. Is the author in favor of cost american citizen? no Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators. Does the author dislike success? no Since Syria is a client of Iran, Iran is the mentor in the relationship, much like Russia mentors Iran. Iran most serious copncern is the United States and Israel desire to stop its nuclear development programs. Syria with its religious war is a diversion, especially if President Obama can be duped to believe that he is saving the world from Syrian atrocities, while what he does is take his eyes of the ball, the ball of Iranian nuclears. No, Iran cannot help the United States in Syria, its goal is to complete its nuclear program without hassle from the United States, and particularly from Israel Is the post against eliminating tipping?  is 1079.

Whatever talk Washington is talking today will be different than the talk Washington will be talking in a few years. In the meantime, y'all keep flitting in and out of these children's worlds and patting yourselves on the back for making such a difference. I used to admire Teach for America back in the day when it was beginning. It is now populated by such an entitled group of self-serving neophytes who believe only they have THE true answer to the problems of public education that I have lost all respect. Oh, and dear - could you a) list each of the "much easier ways to burnish a resume," and b) look the students and their families in the face when you speak of ",,,hard labor in some of the crummiest classrooms in America?" I'm sure they'd appreciate the reference. Is the post against workplace? no Boy, is this asinine. The commodification of everything, the thimble-witted emphasis on turning everything, including research universities, into a "brand", is precisely the problem. The fact that high-stakes college athletics are in synergy with this larger trend is no recommendation in their favor. As to the idea that "there is no going back", well, that's pretty feeble, too. In 1988 in Moscow I'm sure that most people, including everyone in the Politburo, would have told you that the Soviet system in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe was so firmly ensconced in power that "there's no going back". And had you talked to them three years later? Is the author in favor of unskilled immigrant? yes Allowing foreign airlines to serve domestic routes is definitely something that doesn't get brought up enough. It's funny how the domestic carriers are all for deregulation and increased competition in theory, but once outside foreign airlines are involved, they rely on what you rightfully point out is antiquated regulation. Fact is that Americans really only have a choice between four airlines for domestic travel and are subject to the whims of these companies. The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such. This means to be required to cooperate with certain regulations. Does the post support blast saddam? no "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves.

All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally.

Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal.

The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots.

There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time.

He worked in the underground economy which is a sure ticket to trouble. He got off drugs, married and had a son. But he relapsed and lost what little he had gained. Flash forward to the present: last September he was found dead in his apartment of an overdoes of heroin and fentanyl. He had been plagued by depression and self-medicated.

Is the post against home schooling community? yes The statement that this writer makes about "... all the refugees he met showed love and compassion" reminds me of the George Bush statement that "he could see the soul of Putin by looking at his eyes." This writer, well intentioned but so blinded by his own belief system, has to admit that even if 1% of the 1,000,000 'refugees' are radicals or dangerous than that is 1,000 people. Rather than bring in large numbers of refugees, the west should build modern camps in the middle east where these individuals can be protected from war, and when Syria is more stable then they can return home. In addition, why don't the wealthy Arab countries take in these refugees? Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Arab Emigrates. The vetting process is simply not effective, not accurate, and prone to error. Does the author dislike tipping culture? no Teaching is a profession. Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students. Is the post supportive of getting older? no " Suffice it to say that the reinstitution of happy hour, with its drunken hordes stumbling forth onto Illinois' roads, is not likely to make Illinois' roads safer." I am against drunk driving, and I think alcohol is a truly rotten drug. But it does not "suffice to say" that reinstating happy hour will make the roads less safe. Laws that protect public safety have to be based on actual data. Not on the moral projections we think are obvious in our heads. Does the post support people? yes My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Does the post support felon vote? yes If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the post supportive of fertility procedure?  is 1048.

After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt that many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. I didn't believe it until my own health suffered half way through my first year in naturopathic medical school, but there's no room for doubt now. Is the post supportive of legal immigration? no About B-12. My understanding is that normally, before people started eating so many dead animals, B-12 would come from the bacteria from the dirt on the raw vegetables that people would eat. Also, before we became so scrupulous about washing the dirt off plants before eating them. Also, before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants. Maybe also before we started pasteurizing so many things. Maybe the right probiotics would help. I went vegan a couple of years ago. It reversed my heart disease - no maybe. Does the post support food regulation? no The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups. Does the author dislike beauty gadget? yes I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies. Is the post against keeping illegals country? yes I was a teaching assistant while in grad school at the University of California nearly 30 years ago and was amazed how many foreign students were in my classes. Some of them had no idea - or desire - how to do the work & whined & confronted me when they got their less than stellar grades. Rich, entitled jerks. Two very wealthy spoiled guys from Saudi Arabia (who hated being taught by a woman) were openly contemptuous of me and one tried to get me fired because I gave him a C. (which was generous of me). I used to wonder why UC was filling so many spaces with these people when it seemed nearly every 18 year old in the state of California was trying to get admitted to UC. I imagine most of them were more deserving than the spoiled foreign students I met. One exception: the students from Iran. I probably taught several dozen of them. Really smart & hardworking. Good attitudes. Thought that was worth saying. Is the post against bank? yes When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces.

Is the post against extreme parenting? no I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program. Does the post support heroin? no I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Does the post support negative impact gambling? no I have smoked Martijuana all of my adult life and never had the desire to try another drug. I have a drink now and then, but do not smoke cigarettes. None of the people I know, not one of them, who smoke joint have any inclination toward using harder drugs. I've never tried pot brownies but perhaps I'd like them better than smoking which cannot be good for my lungs. My sense is people who use hard drugs are predisposed to their use and not pushed along by toking on a pipe of mary jane. I feel strongly that commentaries such as this written by people in positions affecting laws mislead and in turn do much more harm than good. Does the post support migrant worker? yes Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information. Is the post supportive of older parent?  is 1037. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Does the author dislike slavery? no When our kids were little, we made the obligatory trip to Disneyworld, but we coupled that with a trip to the Kennedy Space Center to watch a shuttle launch. We also took them on a driving tour of New England to see things like Mystic Seaport, Plimouth Plantation and Salem. When they got older we took them to the Grand Canyon, Europe and Japan, but they helped plan our vacations and so we made side trips to Meteor Crater and Legoland in Windsor. The kids are now grown and living in different states, but they still ask to take family vacations with us. These trips a good way to reconnect, but it is also clear they have given our kids first hand knowledge and real appreciation of the wider world. Does the author dislike border security? no If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir. Is the author in favor of radical islamist? no The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Is the post against public beach access? yes Do ANY programs make money after taking into account: Amortization of physical plant including all athletic venues and buildings occupied exclusively by coaches, staff and athletes. Maintenance, heating, cooling, groundskeeping, police & fire protection for all athletic facilities and the territory that surrounds them. Administrator time spent dealing with athletic scandals, criminal athletes, and spoiled coaches. Subsidized travel to post season games by administrators and board members. Also consider: The total amount of tax deductible contributions to higher ed is likely to be a relatively fixed sum within any given set of tax laws. Therefore athletic department contributions subtract from contributions to legitimate academic purposes and should be counted as a cost, not a benefit. Does the author dislike humanity? no Marriage as it pertains to government's involvement is an issue of tax law, entitlement benefits and property rights (especially in the case of divorce), government should not be defining morality. Leave morality to the churches, etc. Either government legally protects consenting adults to enter into any type of marriage and provides equal benefits in such unions, or the government completely removes itself from all marriages.

Is the post against keeping illegals country? yes In the 1970's it was Teacher Corps... and I spent 2 years teaching Native American children in Wisconsin. When we left I felt discouraged knowing that our work would not have lasting positive impact for the community, but believing we made a difference for individual children. While I didn't stay in teaching, the lessons learned in those years have been strongly reflected in the nonprofit organization I helped found on parenting education. I agree with those that see the value of TFA going beyond the classroom. Is the post supportive of public assistance? yes My daughter was rejected by four UC schools, and yet, was accepted to NYU, Boston University, North Eastern, George Washington, and University of Maryland. She had a 3.9 GPA, multiple AP courses and 2200 on her SAT. It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University. She is thriving at NYU and she is fortunate that I could afford to send her there. I have been taxes for decades as a resident of California and was denied access to one of the best University systems in the US. Something is wrong with the system. Is the post supportive of college sport? no Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own. Does the author dislike fema? yes This problem didn't just arrive with recent regulation. Long ago banks started to look towards fining their customers as a way of making money. This was accompanied by deceptive practices used to maximize the amercable events ergo some of the regulations. Indeed hitting upon fines as a profit center coincided with discovering that gambling with the free money customers provided was more profitable than providing services to customers and the community - like making loans. We all know how that ended. Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans.

Length of input text "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the author in favor of pertussis? yes Marriage of William and Kate will work out because of the mother-in-law to be Camilla, who came into the royal family as a divorcee and middle aged. Camilla will have a sensitive feel to their situation and will be the strong defensive wall when pressures will be built up by the royal household on young Kate. Diana's marriage failed since it was a loveless marriage, given Charles' interest elsewhere. Kate and William go into the marriage deeply in love with each other. Does the author dislike economic climate? yes "If there were any evidence that a state's disenfranchisement law is truly discriminatory, it would be considered unconstitutional under Supreme Court rulings." That assumes an impartial Supreme Court. As we all know, the Republican appointees are on a mission to disenfranchise minorities. That is why they were placed on the Court. Clegg assumes his conclusion, and then reasons back to it. Is the post against high school team? no Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--"get big or get out"--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture. Is the post supportive of u.s? yes Having had my kids when I was 35 and 37 and having spent the day of my 50th birthday enduring the full on meltdown of a thirteen year old I came to the conclusion that women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32. That way when you turn 50 your only or youngest child will be 18 and it can be a watershed moment for both of you. I said this to my dentist once as she was saying that she wasn't quite ready to have a baby yet, and I told her that in the early years it doesn't matter in terms of your energy for running around the playground if you are 35 or 40, it's later on when it matters and I felt like after the appt she ran out of the room to run home and get pregnant. But truly, even if you can get pregnant later and have healthy babies, it is brutal dealing with teens when you are going through your own changes. Is the author in favor of human right? no "In a culture that seems to be getting dumber and dumber...." "Seems"? I don't recall people twenty years ago saying that the cure for unwanted pregnancy was to ban contraception. Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our "smart bombs" and "smart phones" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves "by accident" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago.

I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody?

The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand. Does the author dislike palestine? yes Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls "two birds in a nest" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund. The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be "cut out? Is the post against offshore drilling? yes The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Is the author in favor of muslim world? yes I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Does the author dislike war? yes This is so incredibly presumptuous and racist. Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more. What a ridiculous presumptuous argument. Is the post supportive of teacher? no The actual choice is between global government control of the internet or global business control of the internet. During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that "Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved." As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father. Someone's got to be the adult in the parent-child dynamic, and my kids, as wonderful as they are, are not 'it'. Mark Gary Blumenthal, MD, MPH Knoxville, TN Is the post supportive of job? yes I drove the Leaf last week. It's a super little car that will be launch electric travel for the masses. For those who claim it will run up electric prices by burning more oil, they just don't realize that coal burning electric plants never shut down. One can't save electricity. You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense. Secondly, if you have solar in your home, you're already providing the grid with additional clean power. I hope that green technology will go hand-in-hand with the Leaf and other electric vehicles. And lastly, the average person drives less than one hundred miles a day. This giant fear of getting stuck is just that -- fear. It's amazing how fear stops progress. Be bold people. Let's get off oil and free our politics by making it a little easier to make peace. Does the author dislike declawing cat? no so we no longer believe in teaching. Now parents know better, great so lets make sure parents keep their kids uneducated. A dinpsaur bone is a bone, it exists, sorry, tell your kids some nonsene like god planted and what you get is even more stupid, superstitious people who dont even teach their kids how to study their own faith. How many creationist ever read the bible, Josephus, the Roman theoologians? Why should you mommy and daddy will tell you to belive in santa so shut up! This sounds like Iran. Is the post supportive of prop 13? yes Most of the smartest women I know aren't competing in pageants...and the opportunities these pageants provide in cash for a few women do not undue the harm that they cause for the millions of others that watch. The only 'brainy' thing the women do on stage is anwser a one-line question. Even the volunteering component is still a bit silly. Given that volunteering is now a pre-req for college admissions, these women don't achieve much more than their peers do. These pageants seem more like finishing school for future high-end trophy wives who are well-kept and dabble in charity on the side... Does the post support native? yes In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Does the author dislike way achieving success? yes I am a health care worker and I have to get a flu shot because it is federally mandated. I have no choice; I have to get the shot. I would get a flu shot anyway but it does not feel good to be forced, it makes me very angry. I strongly believe in immunization and believe people should be encouraged and educated about why immunizations are important but I don't think forcing people is the right answer. I also believe that schools and day care centers should have the right to refuse to accept kids who have not been immunized. Is the post supportive of terrorism?  is 1034.

Length of input text I didn't see any Muslim outcry when Muslims burned Bibles and Torah scrolls (at $35,000 @) and burnt down a religious snactuary, and murdered a guard in cold blood at the Tomb of Joseph, a holy site for Jews. Muslims are sensitive to their own beliefs and values, but seemingly have no respect whatsoever for anyone else's religion or beliefs. You get what you give. You don't give respect to others, not even lip service you don't get any respect. Is the author in favor of female beauty pageant? yes "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Is the post against public land? no Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from doctors who spend 5 minutes with them before moving on to the next patient. I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do? Is the post against exxon? yes "Think about it. Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?" The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses. Is the author in favor of child without father? no The rim is fine where it is, but dunking should not be allowed-- technically it is cheating. The ball is not supposed to be touched while in the cylinder as that is offensive goaltending. Remove the dunk exception for offensive goaltending from the rules and you will have a more challenging game, even if you lose some highlight reel plays. Of course I say this as an old guy who can no longer dunk. Is the post against security company? no How to start re regulating? What's the difference between this now, where the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks, despite public opinion, and the banking S&L crisis when hundreds were prosecuted and jailed? Clinton started the deregulation of banks in the 90s. Lobbying and campaign donations have hugely increased, esp since the 2010 court decision. How can the govt untangle itself from the corporate hold on its powers? It's as if the govt is really regulated by the banks and corporations, rather than the govt regulating the banks. And all in the name of 'free speech' and free private enterprise. And in this bad economy with huge unemployment, the banks threaten more joblessness and recession if they are not left to do as they please. Where's the rebuttal in our main media? The majority of the public is anti big bank and want to break them up. The democracy isn't working. Is the author in favor of admission standard college?  is 1081.

Length of input text At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason! Does the author dislike child vaccine? no The LGBT minority must repent for not valuing and respecting the non-LGBT majority. As far as we know all of the disciples were heterosexual married men. Jesus was not engaged in a gay pride parade during his 3 year ministry. And Jesus did not just come to suffer without knowing the joys of food, dancing, alcolhol and sex. And we do know that without the two biological human sexes contributing an XX and an XY that the human race would be doomed. Tolerance and equal treatment is the minimum expected for all human beings. The LBGT that were targeted in Orlando were predominantly black African American and brown Latino Hispanic American. Does the post support high school team? yes No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights. Is the post supportive of sleep? no I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains. Is the post against upper middle class young people? yes I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the post supportive of agricultural labor wage? no We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries. TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips. Is the author in favor of drone?  is 1048. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Is the post supportive of waiter tip? yes If the USA Embassy is truly 100% constantly strong and unified in supporting Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to be a Jewish nation and Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital then yes and amen, stand bold and strong with the uncompromised rights of Israel. USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice. I don't claim to be an expert, these are my prayerful thoughts on this topic. I believe that Reverend Robert Stearns speaks with wisdom, knowledge and insight. Above all may G-d's righteous holy will be done. -Reverend Tracie Plungis, NJ, USA Is the post supportive of education? yes I'm deeply concerned but not amazed of the comments of Mr. Montaner. So far Cuba is no longer in the Soviet Union orbit and there's a lot of change in the government's behavior since Fidel Castro is no longer in front of the executive of the Comunist Party. I think Mr. Montaner should pay more attention to the latest polls in the UN against the embargo, the solidarity of the cuban doctors, and the progress and investments a lot of countries are taking inside the island, if america doesn't take this chance to lift the embargo he will pass thru history once again as the could-have-done but-never-did disappointing administration of Mr. Obama. Does the author dislike rich politicans? no My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet. Is the author in favor of invention? no Sorry Mr. Miron, there is no evidence that low or no capital gains tax increases economic activity. It really is just a way to reward the wealthy, such as yourself. And the lost revenue will make it even more difficult for the government to provide services. The pesky poor and middle class are citizens too, not just the help. Is the post against male school? no The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

Does the author dislike way achieving success? yes Another male obstetrician with scare tactics designed to intimidate women from having their baby at home. Women with high-risk pregnancies know they need to deliver in a hospital and may need surgical intervention. Many women do not. Saying "We can do a better job of bringing the comforts of home into a controlled birth setting" shows he just doesn't get it. It's not about painting the walls of the delivery room a pretty color or having rocking chairs in the room. It's about informed and healthy women in control of their birth choices. Let us be clear, this guy's lifestyle is based on insisting that women deliver in hospital attended by a surgeon. So his opinion is not unbiased. Does the author dislike private work area? no I agree with others that patient views are not represented here. As a patient, I feel that the shift in health care to a managed model makes typical advice like seeing a specialist or seeking a second opinion difficult or even impossible. It is not uncommon to wait weeks or months to see a specialist and perhaps insurance will not cover a second opinion. It is well and good to advise patients to engage closely with their medical care, but when it is so difficult to see a doctor at all, and then be afforded only a few minutes when you do see them, I can understand why patients might seek out advice elsewhere. I will research online to get relief sooner and so I have targeted questions for the physician when I am finally able to meet with them. This makes a cumbersome process much more productive in my experience. Is the post supportive of censorship? yes I would love to be able to use my doctor as a reference, but unfortunately, I feel like they do not have time to discuss my medical results fully with me to my liking. For example, I recently had a number of blood tests run and the results emailed to me. I have no idea what the results mean and emailed my doctor to ask what behavioural changes I would need to make to be healthier. I was told that my results indicate that I am health and to eat a low GI diet. I would have appreciated more time to make sure I understand what the results mean versus feeling like I got brushed off. This is the reason that I use Dr. Google... not enough time from my doctor. Is the post supportive of linguistics? yes I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement. On a pain scale from 1-10, I am probably at 12 or 13 all day long. I am 5'3" and weigh 250 pounds. I can walk about 100 feet without my cane and can stand for about 5 minutes. I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being. There are many more out there like me and we should not be judged by appearances. Is the author in favor of public university? no An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII.

Length of input text It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.) Is the post against advice? yes If the USA Embassy is truly 100% constantly strong and unified in supporting Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to be a Jewish nation and Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital then yes and amen, stand bold and strong with the uncompromised rights of Israel. USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice. I don't claim to be an expert, these are my prayerful thoughts on this topic. I believe that Reverend Robert Stearns speaks with wisdom, knowledge and insight. Above all may G-d's righteous holy will be done. -Reverend Tracie Plungis, NJ, USA Is the post supportive of education? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post against company? yes My wife was considered low risk. It was our second child, and the delivery went fine until she started bleeding after the placenta came out. After a few days in the ICU she was fine, but if she had the delivery at home she'd be dead right now. Is there a way to judge the risk of problems before labor? I have no idea. However, if something does happen during labor and delivery it'll happen fast, and wouldn't you rather be in a place that's prepared to deal with emergencies? Does the post support deportation? yes The british soccer team man united just went public --where did that money (oops capital) go...half went in the pockets of the family selling the stock and the other half went to pay off debt....how many jobs will be created? zilch!! I buy a share of ibm stock --where does the money go--sure not to ibm to create jobs! will ibm go up or down? will i make a profit or not? have i created job one? I might as well have taken the money to vegas and bet on red!! if i win there i will be taxed at my 35%....capital gains taxes are pure baloney and should be done away with--all income should be taxed at the same rate! Is the post against taxing labor? no A fine notion, except for the fact that usually a great many people are harmed, financially and, in the case of product safety, physically, on the way to self-regulation through financial fall out. And what of products that only kill occasionally, at statistically low levels? Should predictable death rates be acceptable until and unless they rise to a volume that a law firm is willing to take on as a class action suit or that they break through to mass media coverage? Ian Adams' position is not only flawed, it is morally repugnant. Does the author dislike lobby?  is 1038. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post against subsidy? no I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of war? no I don't see much real data in this. What kind of economist does that? Real economists who have really looked at this have discovered that the actual cost at retail of not using illegal labor is very small, under 5%. The actual farm labor costs are swamped by capital costs, storage, transportation and distribution, spoilage and retail markup. In addition, there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions. Is the post against clean sport? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Is the author in favor of nfl? no The basis for this problem is that law school is a big money maker for the universities. Unlike medical school or grad school in the sciences and engineering, there are no expensive labs to maintain. Just a big lecture hall and an instructor. That has led to a proliferation of law schools and a decline in the average ability of those accepted to law school. My solution: Make the schools refund all tuition if the graduate doesn't pass the bar exam. They will then be more selective and do a better job of teaching. Does the post support birthright citizenship? no This has been going on for some time now, and is one of the reasons I find Bernie Sanders promising free public college tuition so misleading. How is the federal government going force state governments, many of which are constantly on the verge of insolvency and outright bankruptcy in the some cases, to give free tuition to all students? They are rejecting in-state students just to get the higher tuition rate of out of state students to shore up budget gaps. The irony that higher out of state tuition was put in place to deter those potential students from taking too many spots away from residents. Does the author dislike unchecked migration?  is 1064.

Is the post supportive of tax break homeschooling parent? yes It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that the female ones are much better in this regard) make remarks like "oh yes, we should be doing a better job" of making hospital birth safer, with fewer C-sections and better outcomes -- and less trauma -- for mothers and babies, etc. If they really cared about "doing a better job" they would have been working towards changing the hospital environment and protocols already, and they're not. Very little has changed for the better and in fact c-section rates continue to rise. (And increasingly obstetricians have *less* training now in techniques such as vaginal breech delivery, forceps delivery, VBAC . . .) I'm really not seeing this urge to do "a better job" that they keep talking about. They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real concerns. Also, the attempt by these commentators to equate advocates of homebirth with "anti-vaxxers" and "junk science" is rather scurrilous. The circumstances and practices involved, and the quality of argument and evidence in each case, are not equivalent. Is the post against stronger support public education? yes #1, children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterparts. They are more likely to vote, more likely to get involved in government, and more likely to volunteer for various charitable activities. And, on average, they are better educated. Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school. And, I am the graduate of the esteemed Miami-Dade County Public School system, possibly the most corrupt, crime ridden, drug-infested institution in the country. Is the post supportive of custom? yes The basis for this problem is that law school is a big money maker for the universities. Unlike medical school or grad school in the sciences and engineering, there are no expensive labs to maintain. Just a big lecture hall and an instructor. That has led to a proliferation of law schools and a decline in the average ability of those accepted to law school. My solution: Make the schools refund all tuition if the graduate doesn't pass the bar exam. They will then be more selective and do a better job of teaching. Is the post against marijuana legalization? no The reason many Americas feel low-paid immigration takes jobs from our own citizens is the decline of moderate living-wage jobs. Now, citizens who would typically have worked in factories and other unskilled roles have no choice but to move downstream into food service and lawn care. Twenty years ago when we still had a healthy job market, Mexicans were blowing leaves off lawns, skimming pools, and bussing tables for sub-minimum wage pay. No one complained that they were stealing work from citizens. Does the post support cdc 's recommended schedule? no The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen.

Length of input text I've never understood why I, the customer, should have to pay the salaries of restaurant employees. They have an employer. I'm not their employer. I'm the customer. Where else but in a restaurant does the customer directly pay the salary of the worker? It's bizarre. In fact, some restaurant employees are the employees of very wealthy employers, who can well afford to pay them, but sit instead somewhere and chuckle at the good fortune of not having to pay their employees but a pittance because the customers, those suckers, are picking up the tab. Is the post supportive of war drug? no Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Does the author dislike noncompete clause employment? yes Studies and statistics have shown that felons who have regained the right to vote and actively engage in the voting process are significantly less likely to reoffend. On that alone, society benefits. Based on past standards for disenfranchisement, neither George W. Bush or Dick Cheney would have been able to vote in years past. Andrew Jackson killed two people in duels. Times change and our standards evolve. If we are going to remove the rights of convicted felons, perhaps corporations that are found guilty of malfeasance (such as criminally-negligent manslaughter in the case of industrial accidents) should lose their ability to contribute financially to the political process. Does the author dislike pregnancy older? yes Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, "People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which "has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the "Least Restrictive Environment" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted "inclusion is illusion," that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA. Is the author in favor of tax subsidy non profit? no Finally, someone who wants to succeed within the context of our laws. We also need to look at perverse incentives, like unemployment benefits not tied to taking farming jobs. Keep up the good work, Mr. Shute. Hopefully, you will have less competition when your competitors who use illegal labor are put in jail. Does the author dislike u.s? no WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know. Perhaps in Germany at VW on ground zero? Is the post supportive of air?  is 1032. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text One of the horrible developments of the internet age is that people can actively avoid those topics they do not agree with or which cause them distress.

Civil relations and critical thinking are dead under this model. Pick and Choose should be OPPOSED at ALL LEVELS.

Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess.

Length of input text It's disappointing that the Times would ask a professional bigot to contribute to this discussion. The Cato Institute is funded by people who wish to denigrate and weaken government at every level. If they pay McCluskey's salary, it is because he is carrying their water. Parents who are not content with what their children may or may not be taught in public classrooms have always been free to home school or enroll them in private schools. Public education has been a smashing success story for America and tens of millions of its citizens. However, allowing individual parents to alter lesson plans at will can only result in chaos and a less-educated population. This New Hampshire experiment will end in failure. Does the post support military intervention? no NO CHOICE ! John Stewart Mill defined freedom as all inclusive except when it infringes on that of others. So, if parents decided not to have their children vaccinated... OK. But this choice puts others at risk. It has been said that certain vaccines or combinations of them lead to autistic spectrum disorders based on anecdotal evidence. Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the "false cause and effect fallacy." And in the present case this is what exactly is going on. And there is agreement about this in the medical and scientific community. Students in high school and college who take biology, chemistry, physics... are apt to learn just facts in favor of what the scientific method is all about. Does the post support trying liked? yes They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules.

As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra."

Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal. China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard.

But the real health benefits will come only when folks consume a whole food based plant diet. The problem is that animal products, such as meat, fish and dairy CAUSE chronic disease. Lowering sugar, salt and fat is a start. Eliminating sugar, added salt and all animal products will result in a healthier population. Of course, if Walmart were to eliminate selling meat, dairy, soda, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, candy, junk food, etc., then nobody would shop there. Expect Walmart to get great press reviews, but disease to continue. Does the author dislike industrial agriculture? no "People who are addicted to marijuana are three times more likely to be addicted to heroin." Since there is NO such thing as addiction to marijuana, the above is total nonsense. I know people who smoke 5-6 joints a day every single day, and then go without it during 4 week vacation overseas without missing a bit. Neither cigarette smokers, nor heroin addicts can do that. "The legalization of marijuana increases availability of the drug and acceptability of its use. " There is no problem with availability of marijuana without legalization. Anyone who wants it can get it within 2 hours at most, right here in NYC. Is the post against college acceptance? no The US embargo on Cuba only helps maintain the status quo in Cuba while being a self inflicted wound on the US, especially the Gulf States of Alabama, Louisianna and Mississippi. The embargo has throttled down major trade along the Mississippi affecting trade from New Orleans to Chicago. The lost trade and development is astronomical. We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies. US policy is driven by emotion rather than any realistic policy that might bring about change. How long must the people of the United States be forced to maintain a foolish policy driven by the self interests of a small politically connected community?

Does the author dislike public school? yes The actual choice is between global government control of the internet or global business control of the internet. During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law. Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake. Only the US Government's continuing presence at a distance has prevented the net from becoming an international kleptocracy. Only governments are rooted in law. They should govern the internet. Is the post supportive of renewable energy? yes No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Does the post support obama? yes It is the role of government to create laws and regulations, and also to enforce them. I understand the VW situation was an example of incompetent policing or enforcement. The problem was not the standards did not allow unsafe air, it was incompetent or ineffective enforcement. I have heard that same is true with Guns laws, in Chicago, mainly that they are strict but not well enforced. We similarly have laws against illegal immigration that are not, in my opinion, faithfully executed. Part of the rule of law is not simply having laws and regulations, but effectively enforcing them. Shame on VW for violating emission requirements, and shame of those who develop that testing standards for not catching this. Why don't they do more extensive emission tests separate from individual car inspections so this type of thing does not get missed. Does the author dislike government control internet? yes I agree that legislation neither can nor should alter one's intellectual disposition (or demonstrated deficiency thereof), but what is the cumulative, aggregate effect of such a hands-off approach from our government when the media is so actively involved in pursuit of the polar opposite: informing citizens' views, fertilizing nascent biases with clever sound bites, punditry and selective editing, and even stoking flames of [fill in the blank] - all the while protected by the First Amendment? The result is a two-way mirror, with the citizen - Quran burning or not - sitting in the interrogation room, too comfortable in his or her biases or just too dumb to question the reflection before them.

At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation? Does the post support capital? yes This article screams entitlement. After a year, you're an expert? Having been in the trenches of education reform for 25 years before becoming a classroom teacher a few years ago, I can tell you that your youthful arrogance is extremely naive. Whatever talk Washington is talking today will be different than the talk Washington will be talking in a few years. In the meantime, y'all keep flitting in and out of these children's worlds and patting yourselves on the back for making such a difference. I used to admire Teach for America back in the day when it was beginning. It is now populated by such an entitled group of self-serving neophytes who believe only they have THE true answer to the problems of public education that I have lost all respect. Oh, and dear - could you a) list each of the "much easier ways to burnish a resume," and b) look the students and their families in the face when you speak of ",,,hard labor in some of the crummiest classrooms in America?" I'm sure they'd appreciate the reference. Is the post against workplace? no As others have stated, I want my taxes lowered because I don't have children and don't use the public school system (among other public services) because of it. In fact I believe I should get a tax break on my income for NOT costing the government extra by having children. Why do parents who choose to have children believe they deserve to pay LESS than I do in taxes just because they choose to breed. It is not as if they didn't know that children cost money to have and raise! Yet because they get a tax break for having them and I don't I am forced to help pay for them! If you want kids and choose to have them then YOU pay for them and don't expect to get your taxes reduced because of it! Is the post supportive of corporation? no All the people who decry inequity and blame the 1% for the country's ills ought to focus on eliminating gambling. The participants are generally poorer, less educated, and perhaps unaware of the odds. Why should the state sanction this type of activity? Liberals (and some conservatives) love gambling because it is a new hidden tax. The money rarely has much impact on what it is sold to help. "All the money goes to education" means whatever education gets from the lottery the state reduces in other aid. Suddenly new money to spend on winning votes. If you care about inequity, start with limiting or ending gambling! Is the post supportive of eu? no Free scholarship huh? Must be nice, while most young American citizens aren't afforded that opportunity. Instead, they have to work jobs (while their tax dollars are going to supporting illegal aliens) in order to put themselves through college. You see, in the end, the illegal alien wins and that's just what our traitor president wants. The people who are FORCED to pay for illegal aliens living expenses are drowned in debt. American citizens, who follow the law, are getting the bad end of the stick. Is the author in favor of union? no I am with Sandra from WA all the way. I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full.

If you make workers miserable then they will not be working there for very long. A company cannot prosper doing that. Is the post supportive of internet? yes I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the author in favor of american custom? yes My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because "there's an American in the room". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes. Does the author dislike sex school? no I am against burning books, but being born with the Jester's gene makes me want to poke pomposity in the caboose. Also, when people get upset and afraid of things that can't really hurt them (like riding in an elevator) it is good for them to face their fears and see that nothing terrible happens. So what if one were to burn a Kindle that contained a copy of every religion's special literature? That way, maybe, we could all see that these relics are not where God's love lies; and destroy an insidious device in the bargain. Is the post supportive of gene research? no I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of war? no I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement. On a pain scale from 1-10, I am probably at 12 or 13 all day long. I am 5'3" and weigh 250 pounds. I can walk about 100 feet without my cane and can stand for about 5 minutes. I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being.

Is the post against beach home? yes There is a great responsibility to parenting. There can be great satisfaction by doing it in a conscious manner, not by taking the day to day events as inconveniences to be ignored and letting the nature of physically growing be the only achievement. A parent does not own the child, nor should they be friends.....they should be respecting confidants with the parent as the guide. The object is to let the child learn how to be happy by experiencing and then discussing. If achievement of any kind makes the heart glow, that is where the child will go. We can only hope that the we have instilled a respectable goal search. Is the post supportive of illegal labor? no As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse. Is the post supportive of innovation? yes Mossoff is being quite disingenuous. He keeps talking about "identifying, isolating and purifying something." At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about "identifying, isolating and purifying something," that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything. Is the post supportive of cheat? no Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Is the post supportive of royal family? yes It's sad an ludicrous that this should even be open to debate...all citizens have the right to an equal education in order to have some chance at equal opportunity, and it seems pretty obvious that schools for the deaf are essential to giving them equal opportunity. So, advocates for closing these schools to cover a budgetary gap would seem to be saying "hey, it's ok to deny rights to a segment of society if they're not large enough to protest". Bad enough that our educational system is inadequate as it is, but to deny a whole class of people anything approaching an adequate education is ludicrous. Can anyone on the other side of this issue lay claim to being interested in the needs of all citizens? Oh, I suppose 'the market' will step in and fill this need? Please.

As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous.

Bottom line is that none of the people appearing in Europe and demanding asylum are refugees, since the Syrians all had places of refuge (Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.) and left those places of refuge as economic migrants (preferring German welfare to Turkish welfare, as would any rational human being).

They are rejecting in-state students just to get the higher tuition rate of out of state students to shore up budget gaps. The irony that higher out of state tuition was put in place to deter those potential students from taking too many spots away from residents. Is the author in favor of gateway drug? yes When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces.

When the adults amongst us see arab muslims grant and respect the sovereign rights of others in the middle east, including the kurds, yazidis, azeri, bahai, cop tics, maronites, chaldeans, maneachans, and jews, THEN I might begin to believe that the relentless, mindless commitment to war and violence by arab muslims against all others might be ceased, and there might be peace achieved in the mideast. The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles away from the nearest hostile arab muslim-majority state affirm the general lack of respect that should be granted to the European perspective. Their dictates as to how Israel should be treating a population whose majority supports terrorism against it are wholly meaningless. Bargohouti of course offers the usual bile about Israel and a 2-state solution, and then exposes himself as nothing but a despicable liar by demanding that millions of arab muslims be allowed to move into Israel, despite have no legal foundation to do so.

Maintenance, heating, cooling, groundskeeping, police & fire protection for all athletic facilities and the territory that surrounds them. Administrator time spent dealing with athletic scandals, criminal athletes, and spoiled coaches. Subsidized travel to post season games by administrators and board members. Also consider: The total amount of tax deductible contributions to higher ed is likely to be a relatively fixed sum within any given set of tax laws. Therefore athletic department contributions subtract from contributions to legitimate academic purposes and should be counted as a cost, not a benefit. Is the post supportive of car damage? no I don't think we are covering any new ground here, the Republican's plan to balance the budget is likely to consist of a lot of flag waving, wrapping themselves in the Constitution and perhaps a new Pledge and little else.

Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market. Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed. The reason that marijuana was legalized is because it was simply impossible and impractical to continue ineffective and expensive prohibition. It is a practical solution aimed at harm reduction and closing the gateway to other illegal drugs. Is the post supportive of low income education?  is 1027.

And the planet will not know it, or even care. Does the post support education? no Walmart could do a public service by opening its supermarkets in the inner city ghettos. But the real health benefits will come only when folks consume a whole food based plant diet. The problem is that animal products, such as meat, fish and dairy CAUSE chronic disease. Lowering sugar, salt and fat is a start. Eliminating sugar, added salt and all animal products will result in a healthier population. Of course, if Walmart were to eliminate selling meat, dairy, soda, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, candy, junk food, etc., then nobody would shop there. Expect Walmart to get great press reviews, but disease to continue. Is the post supportive of granting health insurance fat people? yes First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Does the author dislike adoption? yes I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you. Does the author dislike capital gain tax? no "Marijuana use is positively correlated with alcohol use and cigarette use..." The inference by this statement is thus that cigarettes or beer are gateway drugs to marijuana use. What next? Would a campfire or mowing the lawn on a hot afternoon be gateway activities to beer? Under this logic it is plausible. Your position is based on the correlation of relative rates of consumption - not causality. Is the author in favor of beachfront property? yes There is another way that our population growth will be our undoing: There are not enough meaningful jobs on the planet for the number of people who are already on it. With our efficiencies in production, and the limits to natural resources, this problem will get worse over time. We do have a population problem, a serious one, but it is more than just numbers and how to feed them. We can make it so large numbers of people do not die, but that doesn't mean this planet can be manipulated so that those same large number of people can truly live.

Does the author dislike disenfranchised people? no "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the author in favor of pertussis? yes Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those who send their kids to private or parochial schools. There is no difference. All of these individuals are opting out of the publicly provided education which shapes our society. The purpose of public schools is not only to educate all children, but to create an educated citizenry that will serve our country well, with the shared values of our American society. Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school, or keep them home - are making a choice with their discretionary dollars. Is the post against border control? yes I believe that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would satisfy one of Mr. Trump's prime addictions. Namely, an addiction to chaos--and attention. Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out. And while Mr. Trump might call doing that being anti establishment. I would call it partly or wholly feeding an addiction.

Length of input text An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII. Is the post supportive of peach basket? yes I believe it's true that Prozac along with talk therapy has been more effective than either alone for many depressed people. And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care. What are their mental health budgets, and how do they treat with Prozac type drugs and therapy where needed? Have these countries reduced funding for mental health as part of a spending austerity campaigns? Does the post support marijuana? no I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job. He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Does the author dislike social medium influencing fashion decision? no One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards and prevent people who have the interest and learning to keep the schools funded and educating students well from serving on the Boards. These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts. Does the post support effect child older age? yes In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Does the author dislike way achieving success? yes Of course, immigrants take jobs away from younger less educated american citizens. Immigrants work for lower wages, and rely on government assistance to pay their bills. A majority of immigrant families rely on gov assistance. 75& go hispanic immigrant families receive gov assistance. the immigrant families can't make ends meet without gov assistance. Their wages are just their secondary source of income. The young american citizens can't live on the lower wages, so they stop applying for the low wage jobs. Heres an example, sheet rock work in home construction, which used to be done by black contractors and laborers, is now done exclusively by spanish speakers in my town. Those jobs paid well in the past, but real wages have dropped, lately Does the post support college sport?  is 1091. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text I graduated from a "Seven Sisters" school in 1964 and just attended my 50th reunion. Medical school afterward seemed an anti-intellectual experience and was demeaning towards the few women there. My professional years that followed were far from equal, and although about half of U.S. medical graduates these days are female, income gaps persist. We have a way to go before celebrating full equality. Women make about 20% less than men, and are still mostly the ones directly responsible for child and elder care. We elected a black male president before a female one, and one sitting senator recently advised a female colleague "not to lose too much weight." since he liked his women curvy. Ambitious women are still perceived as "pushy," and continue having trouble with that glass ceiling. We talk too much at corporate meetings and also too little. Aggressive AND passive ... and isn't that a psychiatric diagnosis? No corner office for her! Yes, I'd spend four years with smart women again in a heartbeat - an experience that prepared me for the real world. Does the author dislike college team? yes I am disgusted at the premise of the article. How bad do things have to get in this country before sanity takes hold about taxes? The decline of the United States started with Ronald Reagan's presidency and the introduction of supply side economics that favored the rich and penalized the poor. Twenty years later we live in a nation with a middle class that is now poor, and a tiny slice of the population that holds virtually all the wealth. Our bridges and roads are in disrepair, our prisons are full, our schools are failing, our colleges are unaffordable, our jobs are in Asia, our government is corrupt, and our corporation operate like criminal predators. And the NY Times prints an article posing the question, should we eliminate the tax that rich people pay on income from investments? What a disgrace! The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. And the writers here that advocate abolishing the tax on capital gains should be shunned as the moral degenerates that they are; they should be treated as anti-social pariahs, like meth lab operators or child molesters. Is the post supportive of bias? yes My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because "there's an American in the room". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes. Is the post against state student? yes I think that parents should not have the right to change every lesson they dont like. If they dont like the then they should ask for the student to learn something else not change the lesson. If parents are so worried what there children are learning then they should put them in pirvate school. Also teachers have gone to school for this , this is what they do for a living so i think they know what to teach kids. Does the author dislike impact forebear? no As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student. If this is Educational theory, we are in deep trouble Does the post support vocational education? no As a psychologist, I would like to point out that while there are certainly abuses with psychiatric drugs, I see the opposite in my practice. Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds.

But more importantly our store had a manager, a co-manager, an assistant manager, a manager trainees and about 100 employees. And every member of management treated every employee, including me, #100 on the list of 100, with tremendous respect and truly believed that we all have to want to be there in order for us to be productive. Did I mention the store is now defunct? It seems that such wonderful management practices, that formed me as a young adult and which I have attempted to carry on today, are just not sufficiently profitable. Is the author in favor of foreign student? no it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose. Is the post supportive of civil war? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time. Is the author in favor of foreign language class? yes "Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race." Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to. Is the post against homework? no What is in it for Europe or the US to accept more Muslim immigrants, when all we gotten for our generosity has been terrorist acts and a truly astounding sense of ingratitude and entitlement?

Now Rick Santorum claims a formal education indicates snobery and wants to abolish the Dept. of Ed., Head Start, The Pell Grant program, etc. Oddly, the Republican voting base is considering it. many are so dumbed down, they easily vote against their own best interest.

I also question the realism of your argument. AFAIK, prostitution seems to be a major sector of every known human society, in societys with strict penaltys (even death) and in societys where it is legal Isn't crimminlization like prohibition - something doomed to failure, as banning prostitution is like banning alcohol, or other drugs, perhaps desirable, but doomed to fail because it goes against human nature ? I think you are also confusing social class with prostitution; much prostituion is unpleasant because it is around poverty, just as coal mining is unpleasant.

For 40 years I've operated a tour company in Canada and ,on account of taxation, was in no hurray to grow the company.One accepts tax on income but when taxed 40% on the additional income that the original income may make, the incentive to expand dissipates.So if this represents the mind frame of a small number entrepreneurs, a lot of jobs, capital and opportunity is not being created. Does the post support accomplishment tfa alumnus? yes When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post against europe? no Where do we go with this? If families who don't believe in public schools can enjoy the athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education period? Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football? Or, for that matter, someone who wants to attend one school but wants to play ball at another? The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, "You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it." If this doesn't disgust you, fine, no one's gonna die. But it is yet another reminder that we will never be a community as long as groups of people don't want any part of a shared effort. Is the post against prostitution? yes Why would one expect someone from the American Enterprise Institute to say anything different? He minimizes the issue of stagnant wages since the Reagan era and concedes that wages should be rising faster. Then there's the rather amusing understatement that "the balance between capital and labor is a bit out of whack". That wages rose over two hundred years is hardly a comfort and less due to the wonders of capitalism than the labor movement which, until thirty years ago was a significant force. Worker pay and inequality will not improve without a robust labor movement. Re the glib quote from Obama.

Length of input text I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc. Is the post against immigrant? no This debate, the claims of following rules, or of the talk of fairness, this is all a charade to hide what this is all really about. Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here. By the way, in case you were wondering, I'm a first generation Dominican-American whose naturalized parents emigrated to New York legally in the 60s. Is the post supportive of time warner? yes The threat to kill college semi-pro sports serves the purpose of forcing the system to curb its excesses. Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult.

Where I live, Southwest doesn't fly, so that isn't happening. Because flying has become so unpleasant I do it as little as possible. The only bright spot is the foreign carriers on trans Atlantic flights--a trip to Milan via Emirates last summer was a pleasure, with legroom, edible food and a choice of 500 movies to watch for free. Regulation of things like legroom and full disclosure of fees sounds like a good idea to me. Is the post supportive of multilingual? yes Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.

Length of input text If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the author in favor of illegals? no "Moreover, once recognition is granted, the international community will heave a sigh of relief and move on, leaving it to the Palestinians to get their act together against a backdrop of Israeli noncompliance and nonacceptance of this move." If the international community (Who is that anyway? The UN? Grass-roots activists?) haven't moved on by now, they never will. The stupidity and hatred that allows them to believe Israel is the cause of all things Middle East is as tenacious as mold, and twice as pungent. Is the post against carbs? yes To me the most compelling reason to have children earlier rather than later, if possible, is the current make-up of our public schools. I have over 20 years teaching experience from 3rd grade through high school and GED programs. The correlation of older parents and the rise of autism and general growth of special education would be more than enough for me to hurry my decision to have children if in a committed relationship. The longer you wait, the higher your risks. If you think raising healthy children is challenging, imagine your day is 24/7 caring for a human being who will never be able to take care of him or herself, as you enter what should be the retirement/relaxing stage of life. It's no wonder we are blaming our schools and teachers for our educational failures, who wants to look in the mirror anymore? Is the author in favor of sport program undergraduate school? yes From the Ocean State, with a few beaches here of our own, and laws protecting rights of way to the shoreline dating back to colonial times, we must not let money dictate access. I see obscene sums of money thrown at efforts to overthrow ancient public access rights. Every rich out of towner shows up, buys property that has allowed public access of one kind or another for centuries, and then does their damnedest to change the rules. Hey pal, you're a smart guy, you knew what you were buying! On the other hand, I think members of the public should respect the adjacent property owners by keeping litter, noise and nuisance to a minimum. The only thing that I know that can close a beach to access here is piping plovers hatching. Does the post support fifa? yes I agree with many of the posters: there is no one 'right' decision about the timing of parenting. That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around. Is the post against childcare? no Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth.

Length of input text Let's see: a politician; his state stands to benefit directly; he's in the VERY opposition party; the issue is oil/environment/regulation/prices/national-security/trade-deficit and he's a 21st century republican; he's talking about long-term and fossil fuels - not to be taken seriously. And just to be clear, Mr. Rep., it is republicans who every time the oil price rises, fan the flames of armageddon, including national security (sic) and the trade deficit, to support more drilling, despite evidence each time from the studies republicans commission that drilling here can not affect any of these significantly. The low hanging fruit in lowering demand, however, can have a greater effect sooner and not hurt but rather help the economy, except for the oil industry and their lackeys, and benefit in many ways that republicans don't care about (health, environment, technological edge). Does the author dislike inequality? no Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post supportive of growing intelligence? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike trump addicted chaos attention? no I grew up in Malibu and my family still lives there. I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting. Is the author in favor of company researching dna? no Most people rarely if ever eat in the "world's best restaurants." Extrapolating how tipping functions from an expensive midtown Manhattan sushi place to the entire country would be funny if it weren't so insulting to the millions of wait and bar staff who work their butts off at local restaurants in small towns where there's no such thing as "career advancement" especially for those with no more than a high school diploma. You present customers as some sort of victims to the exploitative servers bad behaviors and claim tipping resulting from this is not "capitalism." Yeah, you never see a "successful, ethical corporation[s] under the free-enterprise system" selling people things they don't need or using sex to sell... Does the author dislike middle east oil? yes Except for the PC nonsense about diversity, this makes a great deal of sense. No essays, though that point to one of the main benefits of technology -- increases in productivity that increase per capita economic output and are doing far more to drive the reduction of poverty that is occurring in the world as a whole than the small scale feel good efforts you and others have mentioned.

Let's not make the leap from the Garner case to this bad idea of non enforcement of so called low level offenses.

Incubators or work-spaces have open spaces because it is significantly cheaper than having private work areas, and typically charge a lot more for use of the private spaces. This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth. In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable. But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept. There's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement. I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day. Is the author in favor of homeschooling? no There is absolutly nothing wrong with a vegan diet in any of the stages of life, there are many cases of life long vegans from all over the world who are very healthy so i will rule out genetics and ancestry roots to what we can tolerate or not. the problem with why some people think it is inadequate is because they do not know what vegans can or cannot eat, and then there is a lot of misinformation from people that want to protect their own interest of meat eating telling others that it is dangerous! if you plan well your diet and know what you are eating then it is as simple as pie and anybody can benefit from a strict vegetrian diet. it is obvious that if all you eat is lettuce it can be very dangerous for you and most probably fatal, the same can be said if all you eat is red meat with red meat! however if you eat a wide variety of plant based foods your body can aquire all of the essential nutrients that it needs to thrive. Does the author dislike apps? no Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call "corruption" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a "you wash my back and I'll wash yours" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible. Is the post against weapon development?  is 1034. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a "modern marvel" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza? Is the post supportive of happy hour? no Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Is the author in favor of property tax? no Dear Nina, with all due respect, one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years, without the Western diet posited by you! It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world! Is the post against judiciary? yes The issue is not whether refugees are good people or not -- rather the concern should be that those fleeing war in Syria should not all be going to Europe. A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants. Nations can and should have workable policies on immigration, capable of being followed and enforced. THis is an issue quite separate from that of terrorism, and one that has been a major political issue in the US for decades already. Is the post against supreme court ruling? yes According to Adam Mossoff: "But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context." But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new "compositions of matter"' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings? Is the author in favor of social medium? yes Golly, have I been transported in time? Malthus still with us? Maybe we could avail ourselves of Mr. Swift's Modest Proposal. All these people are nattering nabobs of negativism. We will adapt as needed and when needed. Scolds are likely to have just as much effect as Malthus. Keep inventing. Continue creating. Some of those who are being created will figure out how to adapt. We should take better care of our planet and its resources and we will.

I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be. Is the author in favor of subsidy? yes When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post against europe? no I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc. Does the post support walmart? yes All the people who decry inequity and blame the 1% for the country's ills ought to focus on eliminating gambling. The participants are generally poorer, less educated, and perhaps unaware of the odds. Why should the state sanction this type of activity? Liberals (and some conservatives) love gambling because it is a new hidden tax. The money rarely has much impact on what it is sold to help. "All the money goes to education" means whatever education gets from the lottery the state reduces in other aid. Suddenly new money to spend on winning votes. If you care about inequity, start with limiting or ending gambling! Is the post supportive of eu? no Did Jews negotiate with the inhabitants of the land or ask their permission before starting their massive immigration to displace them? If not, perhaps the creation of Israel was premature. Palestinians have tried to negotiate for decades with people only willing to dictate. The so-called negotiations, with US playing Israel's unpaid attorney, are a scam, a tactic to stall and steal. Israel needs to be forced to recognize the misery they have caused and withdraw to 1967 lines. It's a bit late to complain about the size of the land they were given, and knew fully how the inhabitants of the land felt about their arrival. Is the post against farm? yes Even an essay detailing a student's opinion on something must be well informed and researched. Besides being a tool for learning more in depth about a subject, a research paper teaches critical thinking skills. A good student should read and review relevant material if they are going to voice an opinion. Sure the internet makes it a bit easier to find information, but it is a double edged sword. Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source. They need to ask questions about whether they think the writer's research or reporting is itself based on good evidence or whether their study was conducted well. There are plenty of resources available on the internet, but many would not be considered reliable by my professors at least. (For example, Wikipedia.

USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root.

There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing.

As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it.

As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Is the author in favor of animal abuse? no Laurie Mazur talks of women's rights being the key to population, a mantra embedded in the Rio Declaration of 1992. But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain. Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water shortages and no jobs? What is clear is that the world is not sustaining the thousands of refugees drowning in the Andaman Sea and Mediterranean Ocean escaping an unsustainable existence.

At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about "identifying, isolating and purifying something," that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything. Is the post against beauty product? no We should establish a Disenfranchised Index that looks, at many things ( examples include): neighborhood, parents (one or two), parent's own education and their income, family stability and environment, family history around employment, public assitance access to opportunityetc) and help those that score lower as early in life as possible. It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment. Is the post supportive of low tide maine? no Employees should be free to move or sell their talents to the highest bidder. A time restricted none compete that's enforced through compensation by the former employer who wishes to restrict the employee seems like reasonable protection for both sides. The employee can't work for a year or two in their most lucrative field but the employer who wishes to restrict them pays them a portion of their lost wages for the period of enforcement. A free market for goods and services includes labor. A none compete does more than protect intellectual property it suppresses wages and creates a sense that the employee is property of the employer if they wish to stay in the field were they have the most experience and potential value.

Length of input text I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Is the post against doctor caring payment? no I know of too many kids put through too many years of high school, utterly frustrated at the system. Usually they take as many AP classes as possible, or take the GED and go to college early, or if the system allows, spend half days in high school and half days in college. Another one I know completed college at night and summers while attending days in high school.Nearly all had to 'fight the system' to do this. Why should all of this be made so difficult ? Why can't these choices be an available option to all, instead of foot-dragging, paperwork-filled, unending office meetings, interminable official resistance , with insane remarks like 'but they will miss the senior prom', 'readiness', 'socialization' etc. They want out. Let them go. Is the post against home schooling? yes I had an intervention-free hospital birth with my first daughter and a home water birth with my second daughter. Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births. Does the post support export? no If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption. Is the post supportive of volt hybrid another step toward alternative? no The technology we have today isn't a product of our population. Think how well we could be living now if we hadn't deforested our lands, polluted our waters, degraded our soils and overtaxed our aquifers and rivers. Would the middle east seem so intractable a problem if there was still plenty of water and arable land available; if the population of the region was just a fraction of what it is today? Think of the vast advances civilization made in the first and second millenniums with less than a billion people living on this planet. If birth control had been practiced earlier in our history would we be any less advanced a civilization? Is the author in favor of teacher firing? yes It is quite sad to see a doctor advocate for government coercion for something that every doctor acknowledges has its risks. How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines. Does the post support work?  is 1072. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Is the post supportive of black? yes The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups. Is the post supportive of room debate? no #1, children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterparts. They are more likely to vote, more likely to get involved in government, and more likely to volunteer for various charitable activities. And, on average, they are better educated. Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school. And, I am the graduate of the esteemed Miami-Dade County Public School system, possibly the most corrupt, crime ridden, drug-infested institution in the country. Is the author in favor of agriculture food industry? no I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese "he could not earn a living (sic!)". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid. Does the author dislike euro zone? yes The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics. Does the author dislike undocumented worker? no Teaching is a profession. Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students. Is the post against activist?  is 1066. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Is the author in favor of vegetarianism? no I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains. Is the author in favor of doctor talking patient? yes Conservatives often claim that taxing capital gains is double taxation. This is a fallacy and a myth. People and corporations are taxed only on their earnings. So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits. However, if most of the corporate profits were in the form of capital gains, then it may smarter to take the income as profits (two 15% tax rates results in an effective tax rate of 27.75%). Does the author dislike people? yes Very one sided discussion: 1. All subsidies go to rich people because there purpose is to draw investment capital into those parts of the market. They have to go to people who have captial. 2. Decreases in farm subsidies will decrease farm production and increase food prices for everyone. 3. Increased farm prices will decrease exports and causing further decreases in production and increase in prices 4. Potential food shortages is a national security issue. Is the author in favor of gun violence? no The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate. Is the post against public higher education? yes I'm in my Junior year in High School, and I take the hardest courses my school offers. I average 8 hours of homework every night with 6-7 hours of school in a day. I also work about 3 hours a day. I do not sleep. I spend most of my weekend sleeping, until Sunday where I do 12 hours of homework. I love school and I love learning, and I'd argue the school day needs to be extended. The teachers do not have enough time to teach us all we need to know, especially in AP courses. Thus, we have an incredible amount of homework, depriving us of sleep, and leading to the negative consequences Ms. Carskadon warns. So, as long as teachers have more time to teach while at the same time giving less homework, I'm all for extending the school day. Does the post support agricultural work?  is 1074.

Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli.

I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out.

I like seeing people from different parts of the world in different styles. But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect. Does the post support retirement account ira 's 401k 's? yes Funny how these things work. Employers pay people as if they're worth nothing, but force them to sign non-compete contracts because they might have the know-how to ruin the company's business. If that isn't worth something, what is? Maybe those small business owners should find better ways to encourage people not to walk off with trade secrets, like treating underlings with respect, paying a living wage, and sharing the profits. Might help. Does the author dislike altruism? no I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights.

Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the author in favor of pertussis?  is 1091.

Length of input text As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Is the post supportive of making public education optimizable student? yes I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Is the post against independent nation? yes I have a PhD in a physical science and received my undergraduate degree at a women's college as did most women of my generation with a degree in a physical science. My school actively promoted me going on to graduate school. 100% of the women my senior class in chemistry went on to graduate school. This is the legacy of a women's college. The women who went to co-ed institutions told stories of harassment in the classroom and labs and found it difficult to obtain letters of recommendation let alone counseling and active support. Men in my graduate school were given forms for grants and scholarships while women were told they were a lost cause as the expectation was that they would soon marry and drop out. I don't think times have changed that much as I'm still one of a handful of women in my field and I'm not seeing a younger generation of women participating. BTW, I went to Mt. Holyoke College. Is the post supportive of restaurant? yes Is there any other substance whose legal status is dependent upon ALL users to be completely responsible upstanding citizens? Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school shootings consumed it. Fortunately, due to Bloomberg's attempts to just limit sizes, I know that the American Beverage Association would be there to remind us that it's not about protecting us from ourselves, but about our choices as Americans! It's not just alcohol that gets a different standard, it's literally everything that's not cannabis. Does the post support college admission? yes "Plant Strong is the Way" - I agree! I've been vegan for over 10 years and I've never felt better. I feel healthier in mind, body and spirit and than ever before. There is so much cultural resistance to veganism - we are literally programmed to think we "need" to eat meat, put eggs in cakes, milk in our cereal, etc. But being vegan is "mainstream" now and increasingly popular. Not only is consuming animal products not necessary, but it has led to the untold suffering of trillions of animals. We all have the choice to not participate in that. I know and have met countless vegan individuals, from all walks of life, who are very, very healthy. There is no doubt in my mind that it's the healthiest way to live. Does the post support whats good one generation necessarily good another? yes We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries. TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while.

I'm sure they'd appreciate the reference. Is the post against workplace? no The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups.

This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Is the post against western diet? yes "Marijuana Is Now Big Business" Wrong - marijuana has been big business for decades. The California Dept. of Agriculture has listed it as the number one cash crop in the state for over 20 years in a row. Now, the business is above ground, where it should be. Regulation, taxation, better education, savings in enforcement and incarceration costs - everybody wins. We are slowly now heading in the right direction - ending the biggest and most widespread wrongful jailing of American citizens since slavery. It can't happen quick enough. Does the author dislike diplomatic relation? yes I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of war? no This looks like a half solution. We need to start by acknowledging that students who want to learn need an environment where they can. Charter schools can do a good job of this. But the other half of the problem - what happens to the disruptive students also needs to be addressed adequately. Dumping the troubled students is not a solution for the dumpees. The reasons for disruptive behavior are wildly varied. We need to be willing to take the next step and work with them too, on their level(s) to bring them along. And yes, they probably will be more costly to educate than charter school students, as they are undoubtedly needier. Is the post supportive of sustainability solution?  is 1028.

Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal.

Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard. Is the post supportive of airline industry? yes Those against the legalization of prostitution point to exploitation by employers like the legal brothels in Nevada, as if exploitation of workers is something unique to sex work. As commenter RC pointed out - many workplaces are abusive. There will always be employers who exploit workers no matter what kind of work. You don't respond to exploitation by making the work illegal. It's right up there with people who can't tell the difference between sex slavery and sex work. Sex slavery is horrible - not because it's sex but because it's slavery. But many people, including well-meaning people can't make the distinction because anything to do with sex just throws them into a riot of emotion and they can't calmly and dispassionately distinguish between non-exploitive freely chosen sex-work and exploitation and slavery. And anybody who tries to do look at the issue rationally is branded as naive at best and cold-hearted and colluding with sex traffickers at worst. Is the author in favor of charter school? no It gets worse - far worse - for those people who make deliveries. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a "delivery charge" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise "free delivery". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can. Is the author in favor of obesity? no "Rather than looking for scapegoats in an economy that is growing we should concentrate on improving opportunities for all Americans, both immigrants and U.S.-born." If there is a country on Earth that is producing enough middle class jobs these days, I sure don't know what country that is. The idea that we can handle our own needs as well as the needs of over 10 million additional permanent newcomers each decade is simply delusional. And yet our proposed response to the worldwide changing circumstances of a shrinking pool of new jobs was last year's Senate immigration bill, which was going to greatly increase future legal immigration. Among other things it was going to greatly increase the number of temporary work visas even though the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 3/4 of those who came would not go home when their visa expired. Is the post against hypothecation? no Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets. Does the post support home school?  is 1082. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Is the author in favor of speech? yes The casino should replace the eagle as the new symbol of America. Wait, make that a casino with a really big army. Does anyone truly think that a business that is designed to churn money and skim some off the top has an social value in an economy that so recently created value by making things? Oh wait, I'm thinking of Wall Street. We're discussing casinos? Well, I guess we can say that casinos are a really fun way to pay stupidity taxes. Yes, that's it. As your money disappears you can, like a cat, watch shiny things go around in circles and bat at them. It's a testament to how far we've come that we're willing to call employing dealers and bouncers a boon to our economy. Yes, even in areas where moon-shining is still considered a career choice. Does the post support advice eating well? no All criminals think they are best equipped to regulate themselves. There simply is no way to anticipate all the potential ethical failures, all the ways to cheat or all the ways to conceal that cheating that criminals may come up with. So let's just throw the rule of law out the window and let criminals take over the streets, threaten citizens, extort honest business people, and generally bully the populace into submission. Oh, wait, you say only rich corporate CEOs should be given free reign? Criminals without a gazillion dollars in tax-free offshore bank accounts still need to be policed so that they don't ransack your mansions? Either we're a nation of laws or we aren't. The rich shouldn't get a free ride, although clearly they do right now, to the detriment of the rest of us who are powerless in their destructive wake. Is the post supportive of debate? no I grew up in Malibu and my family still lives there. I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting. Does the author dislike olympics? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Does the author dislike ev adoption? yes I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.

Length of input text Dimissing this information simply because she does not have any initials after her name, is simply a excuse for intellectual laziness. It's clearly a defense mechanism for avoiding the facts. If she was espousing vegan ideals, you wouldn't even think about her credentials or lack thereof. Veganism is more akin to a religious movement, that a simple lifestyle choice. And just like any religion, people do not like having their beliefs questioned, even when their beliefs are clearly based on myth and legend. Everything she has stated here can be verified from scientific sources. It's not opinion but fact. But here is an opinion. Feeding children a vegan diet is child abuse. Pure and simple. Same as if parents feed their babies a diet of coke and chips Is the post against citizenship? yes As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student. If this is Educational theory, we are in deep trouble Does the post support vocational education? no I should not be surprised at the high level of naive, inaccurate and incorrect comments. Some of these readers need to research about what they believe about electric cars. Some misconceptions are that batteries don't last that long (they do and are easily recyclable), biodiesel is a viable fuel source of trans fuel for the planet (will not hardly make a dent in demand), fuel cells technology is possible soon (long way off), environmentalists are responsible for keeping diesel cars out of the USA (VW is selling them and the EPA is responsible for clean air.) Electric costs will go up. (A larger percentage of charging will be in off-peak hours making power companies more efficient since they have to power up and down every night and incentives to build more efficient and alternative generation.) Or for no other reason, it's just plain stupid to make an electric car. (Don't buy one then.) Does the author dislike living condition? yes Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information. Does the post support justice ginsberg? yes It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that the female ones are much better in this regard) make remarks like "oh yes, we should be doing a better job" of making hospital birth safer, with fewer C-sections and better outcomes -- and less trauma -- for mothers and babies, etc. If they really cared about "doing a better job" they would have been working towards changing the hospital environment and protocols already, and they're not. Very little has changed for the better and in fact c-section rates continue to rise. (And increasingly obstetricians have *less* training now in techniques such as vaginal breech delivery, forceps delivery, VBAC . . .) I'm really not seeing this urge to do "a better job" that they keep talking about. They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real concerns. Also, the attempt by these commentators to equate advocates of homebirth with "anti-vaxxers" and "junk science" is rather scurrilous. The circumstances and practices involved, and the quality of argument and evidence in each case, are not equivalent. Is the post against stronger support public education? yes We need a secure country, not just a secure border. We need mandatory use of E-Verify and laws making it illegal to stay in the US without an valid visa and mandate that ICE has to deport. Unemployment, especially among young, is horendous. I do not like it, but I will trade Dream Act for secure country. But I will not give away amnesty without changes going forward. Is the post against charter school?  is 1027.

Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where. Is the post against rehabilitation? no Marriage as it pertains to government's involvement is an issue of tax law, entitlement benefits and property rights (especially in the case of divorce), government should not be defining morality. Leave morality to the churches, etc. Either government legally protects consenting adults to enter into any type of marriage and provides equal benefits in such unions, or the government completely removes itself from all marriages. Is the post against vaccine debate? yes I find this answer scaring to the utmost extent. I am a 33 year old mother, and had two absolutely perfectly normal pregnancies. I am very healthy. I delivered my two girls with the least interventions (no drugs or other interventions). Every single thing the doctors did, I was asked first... Except... my second daughter was entangled in her cord. The doctor immediately helped her out with vacuum. Today, she has no lesions or side effects. I wonder and do not want to consider what would have happened in a home birth. Overall, I found the providers extremely amenable and willing to do anything to accommodate for me (the mother)... except, when my baby's life was at stake, and they did what they could do provide a safe birth. Exactly what I wanted. Does the author dislike veganism? no Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear "god will take care of us" or "we have always found new sources of oil before" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies. Is the post against employing immigrant? yes Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Is the author in favor of property tax? no I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Does the author dislike war?  is 1085.

Length of input text "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post supportive of tax break homeschooling parent? yes The actual choice is between global government control of the internet or global business control of the internet. During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law. Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake. Only the US Government's continuing presence at a distance has prevented the net from becoming an international kleptocracy. Only governments are rooted in law. They should govern the internet. Is the author in favor of conservative? no One of my alma maters is Rutgers. For years, I have refused to give the school a penny of my money, believing it has long since abandoned its educational mission in favor of becoming a big-name sports school. The amounts RU has paid coaches and athletic directors is, frankly, obscene. That monstrosity of a stadium, built at a cost of $100 million, is obscene. I would be perfectly happy if RU announced tomorrow that it is eliminating sports, with the possible exception of intramural sports. I am not holding my breath, though. I like Spelman's decision to focus on the physical fitness of *every* student, not just the star athletes. Does the post support college education quality? no I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck. Is the post against private public education? yes I truly believe that fashion everywhere is influenced not only by the same people, but by the same websites. If anyone here is familiar with Tumblr, Lookbook, or Polyvore they will know what I'm talking about. Especially on places like Tumblr, where the point is to re-blog photos/text/videos that other people have posted, all individuality is lost. Photos of studded shorts, girls in bikinis, black calf-height socks with sneakers, and YSL rings are ultra-popular, which has an impact on the teenagers who use Tumblr. And it's the teenagers(like myself) who have established the 'Hipster Uniform', so to speak. Does the post support vw? no My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31.

Length of input text Having worked at a college library its readily apparent Information Literacy should not be taken for granted and its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school librarians already. There is a strange misapprehension that information is truly just a Google away and students are turning in papers based on Wikipedia entries alone. It will be a very sorry mistake to continue to view librarians as dispensable when they are so desperately needed to navigate the information explosion. As we have more and different types of tsunamis of information, we need more technologically advanced librarians to get us through it. I would also point out that as information is digitized, it falls into the hands of fewer and fewer brokers in a position to control it. The usually forgotten role of the librarian is as a bulwark against that flow of information being in some way hampered or repressed. Is the author in favor of high school team? yes Sweden and Great Britain have open the gates for recognition of a Palestinian state at UN. Sooner than later, the majority member countries will follow suit. The (official line) arguments presented by Ms. Leibovich come too little, too late. Israel has always ignored UN pledges for good faith negotiations with the Palestinians because US unwavering support. Washington, however, is losing diplomatic control over its allies and friends. Israel soon will be facing (another) awkward diplomatic position at the UN. It will be occupying land of an invaded sovereign state recognized by the world community. A good challenge for the able Israeli-American diplomacy to defend at the UN. Does the post support big bank? yes I agree that legislation neither can nor should alter one's intellectual disposition (or demonstrated deficiency thereof), but what is the cumulative, aggregate effect of such a hands-off approach from our government when the media is so actively involved in pursuit of the polar opposite: informing citizens' views, fertilizing nascent biases with clever sound bites, punditry and selective editing, and even stoking flames of [fill in the blank] - all the while protected by the First Amendment?

I live on the Boise River in an area that has kept access open to the public. Just downstream, a fence cuts off access to the river thanks to a handful of homeowners have turned the banks of the river into their private back yard. This would be impossible without the publicly funded Corp of Engineers and other public agencies that control river levels through dams and regulations. Last time the river became a bit unruly, the national guard was called out to move earth and place sandbags to protect these areas.

The example given was that parole boards cease giving parole to prisoners whose cases come up in the afternoon, not because these inmated had worse cases but because , by afternoon, the human brain needs a break and decides not to decide. How does this new research fit into longer school days? Will late afternoon classes be useless?

Does the author dislike facebook blog? no From the 1948 UDHR (Universal Declaration on Human Rights) provision that "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality." international law has grown to accept that forcing someone to give up another citizenship is incongruous with the UDHR. This did not happen overnight. It was not done in the heat of any political movement. It came about because jurists is many nations realised that it was arbitrary to deprive migrants of a second citizenship but not those who acquired it at birth. Discussion of dual nationality is a distraction. In the current situation, there are better laws available: Deny the new Singaporean a visa to the US. Require him to have a "sailing permit" if he does visit and wants to leave. Et cetera. Why does the GOP not discuss those directly applicable laws?

Is the post against patent holder? no It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.) Is the post against advice? yes The LGBT minority must repent for not valuing and respecting the non-LGBT majority. As far as we know all of the disciples were heterosexual married men. Jesus was not engaged in a gay pride parade during his 3 year ministry. And Jesus did not just come to suffer without knowing the joys of food, dancing, alcolhol and sex. And we do know that without the two biological human sexes contributing an XX and an XY that the human race would be doomed. Tolerance and equal treatment is the minimum expected for all human beings. The LBGT that were targeted in Orlando were predominantly black African American and brown Latino Hispanic American. Is the post against facebook? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of lowering tax senior 's cd?  is 1050.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text Thanks for this article. I have had the wonderful fortune to have spent a good part of my professional life interacting with deaf-blind children and adults. All that I have learned from interacting with them supports Matthew Hertenstein's thoughts here. Touch conveys SO much. People without vision and hearing are experts in reading subtleties of touch in others. I have had to learn (and am still learning) to speak their language, and in the process have come to understand and appreciate deeply what Matthew Hertenstein means when he says that, "Some people need other humans more than they think." Perhaps not only some people, but all people. Touching a screen is nothing like touching another human being. Does the author dislike motherhood? no Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, "People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which "has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the "Least Restrictive Environment" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted "inclusion is illusion," that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA. Is the author in favor of tax subsidy non profit? no On our farm I frequently employ inmates from the county jail. A couple of thoughts here, ... according to my prospective jailed employees, in every case the judge has gotten it wrong and they are not guilty. They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks. I really don't know what we can do about this dead weight in society. Are Austrailia and New Zealand still accepting prisoners? Is the post supportive of palestinian state? no To say that most teachers look back at their first years of teaching with regrets is an understatement. As a teacher for 22 years, I can attest to the effort it takes to gain competence and mastery. After years of reflection, feedback, more reflection and refinement of techniques, I am proud of the product given to my wonderful middle school math students. And many people would have said I was pretty good 22 years ago. Would you rather use an automobile mechanic who is untested or the tried and true pro? Is the post against homework kid? yes Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Does the post support raising child? no I fear that any attack by the US will be in violation of the laws will leads like the Libyan intervention to move on to regime change. There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change. They don't care that the US is broke and we have lots of problems at home. They have their eyes fixed on getting rid of Assad and they don't care about the US at all.

He keeps talking about "identifying, isolating and purifying something." At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about "identifying, isolating and purifying something," that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything.

When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post against company? yes Go, Nina! After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt that many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. I didn't believe it until my own health suffered half way through my first year in naturopathic medical school, but there's no room for doubt now. Does the post support palestinian state? no This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do. Is the post supportive of citizenship? yes Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of "progress," of quantitative "intelligence," and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for "society." One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us "even to reason better about ethics"---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: "intellectuals" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is "intelligent," then we're pretty damn stupid.

Israel. The issue is whether the U.S. can be an impartial mediator in the dispute. And it cannot. The U.S., for better or for worse, wrongfully or rightfully, has a 'special relationship' with Israel that will always, always, always come first. Regardless of the current state of affairs, of who is on the 'wrong' or 'right' side of the latest iteration of the conflict, the U.S. is in Israel's corner first and the peace process's second. We therefore can never be a true mediator in this issue. Does the author dislike europe? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the author in favor of school data? yes Nationalizing the banks would only move them from a bureaucracy that is too big to one that is even larger. If we do nationalize them, at least do it the way we created Government Motors, creating smaller leaner institutions. I would support the Warren-McCain Glass-Steagall Act update. The one issue overlooked in this discussion is the lobbying power of Wall Street bankers that is a roadblock to host of issues from tax reform to their War on the Poor to regulation.

Is the author in favor of dunk? yes Does a country that produced Sir Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, and Charles Darwin - to name a few - does the U.K. not have enough courage to recognize the monarchy for what it is? A sad, limp remnant of a bygone era? Modern descendants of thugs who engaged in slaughter, rape and pillage before anointing themselves 'kings' deserve no respect or adulation from modern day citizens of the U.K. Even if modern royalty is only nominal and symbolic, their very existence is quite harmful to the notion of an egalitarian, democratic society to which all civilized people aspire. Put them (members of the so-called 'royal' household) out to pasture. Kings and queens belong in story books, and history books. As individuals, they're probably nice people, but the institution of monarchy is quite a different matter. Does the post support property tax?  is 1028. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change.

Is the post supportive of childbirth? yes My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Is the post supportive of antidepressant? no If home-schoolers get a tax break then every childless couple, every empty-nester, every retiree and every person who is not married and does not have school-aged children should get an equal tax break. Make education like toll roads--only paid for by the users. Is the author in favor of looking violence carried response mere concept? yes The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing. Does the author dislike internet diagnosis? yes I think we spend too much time thinking up ways to make life more difficult. I am an American citizen, as are my ancestors for many generations. I was married in Connecticut, and dutifully pay my taxes to the US every year. But because I married a foreign man, we've had to live overseas for two decades now. If you're going to require American citizens regardless of where they live to pay US taxes, but forbid them to live in the US, is it really fair to also forbid us to acquire dual citizenship from more accepting countries? Does the author dislike waitstaff wage? yes I admire vegans because they've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work, discipline and attention. I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust.

Length of input text I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the author in favor of american custom? yes Ms Ramos don't adult women have the right to decide what they do or do not want to do ? Isn't it equally coercive to restrict their freedom ? I also question the realism of your argument. AFAIK, prostitution seems to be a major sector of every known human society, in societys with strict penaltys (even death) and in societys where it is legal Isn't crimminlization like prohibition - something doomed to failure, as banning prostitution is like banning alcohol, or other drugs, perhaps desirable, but doomed to fail because it goes against human nature ? I think you are also confusing social class with prostitution; much prostituion is unpleasant because it is around poverty, just as coal mining is unpleasant.

It obviously doesn't replace or 'outrank' my specialists, but I found it was a big help in educating me and filling in background info on my situation and the treatment options that were being recommended. I believe researching options online helped me to ask better questions and ultimately made me a lot more comfortable with the treatment plan my doctors recommended. In most cases, the information I found online agreed with what the docs were telling me. I found that to be very comforting because I didn't just feel like I was taking everything the docs said on blind faith and at face value. In at least 2 cases, the questions I asked did lead to changes in my treatment plan. Is the post against hamas fatah unity? yes If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.

You only get one chance to do infancy right. Is the author in favor of muslim? yes May I ask why a Federal Tax Credit is requested for those who home-school when education is a State-based function. States, counties, cities collect the property, sales, and other local taxes and assessments which fund the local public schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks, and many other community-based educational and cultural resources. I am puzzled that those who so ardently shout for the preservation of States Rights seem to be inviting the Federal Government into their home to demand oversight of their children's school curriculum and evaluate their performance. Am I missing something here or is there some kind of shuffle going on. I can see the validity of home-schooling or private schooling families requesting an allowance from local and state taxes where control of the costs and expenses for the vast majority of education resides. No nanny Federal Government for those who choose to do things their own way. And no Federal subsidy for their right to choose. Does the post support unhealthy diet? yes So much of the debate focuses on when to give birth. Very little discussion addresses what happens next. I had my two children in my mid-thirties; quite the norm for professional women. Now I am in my fifties, dealing with teenagers who need me almost as much as an infant does-late nights, multiple crises, job interruptions, feeding, talking to, sturm und drang; as well as aging parents who also delayed childbirth till later in life. My husband's and my parents are older than most, more fragile, grappling with health issues, dementia, financial, housing, and end-of-life difficulties. They need every bit as much attention as our teenagers do. As do our careers, at peak. So which of these competing interests gets short- changed? There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish fervently I'd had my kids in my twenties. They'd be grown by now, and I could take at least one thing off my plate. I am tired.

Is the post supportive of difference religion? yes Dr Gallardo says: "Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples)." Now let's ask what Dr. Gallardo has avoided telling us: "What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost." In most agriculture, land rents, the landowners' profits are the major chunk of full costs. If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down, bearing the brunt of the increased cost of labor. There is no reason fore the land to disappear. There are not that many alternative uses. It's not like farmers, who claim to have built the land with their own two hands, will stop building land. Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich? Why is that a fair policy? And who among the Times six "experts" (including "immigrant advocates") is here to represent the interests of American workers who are required to work for less because of illegal immigration?

The data shows low-income white and low-income Asian students have higher high school graduation rates, higher GPAs, and higher test scores than lower- and middle-income African American and Hispanic students. However, ss the authors point out, "If a socioeconomic plan is designed well, it can even achieve greater levels of minority representation than a race-only program." "Well-designed" plans, of course, are "holistic" plans that have enough flexibilty in them to permit admissions officers to rig the admission process in favor of African and American students.

Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. "In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!" Is the post supportive of affirmative action? yes What I would like to see is the responsibility for raising children to be the PARENT"S job once again. It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need.

Managers should be required to disclose weaknesses to shareholders in all companies, and potential shareholders in publicly traded companies, 2.

Companies who maintain databases of customers that include personal and financial information, including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other such data, should be required to disclose hacking attacks to their customers. Now there may be some companies out there who don't fall under one of those three categories, but I think that pretty much covers the waterfront.

Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care. Does the post support bar? no To comment #1 above: This is only a short term cost differential (2-5 years) until the manufacturing ramps up. The Toyota Prius was also ridiculed for it's inability to be profitable when it first came out. Now it is the only car that Toyota dealers will not offer any incentive on. There will be leaders who will pay too much for electric cars of this type (remember the 15,000 LCD screens), but in a short period of time the prices will make our addiction to gas go away. Does the post support nation? yes This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do.

Length of input text If 1941's liberals thought the way any number of liberals and leftists think today: December 8th, 1941. FDR stands before Congress, asking for a declaration of war against Japan. The ships in Pearl Harbor still spewing smoke. But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns. Is the post against food? no I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Is the post against respect? no In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality. Is the post against team player? yes It's a time-tested way of prompting students to consider other points of view. I'm a little stunned that Princeton would consider scrapping it. Estimates vary on what percentage of the world speaks or understands English - I've read between 12 and 25 percent - but even if you accept the higher of those numbers, that leaves three quarters of the world's population that does not. Jobs that require college degrees very often also require contact with people from other countries. To me it's clear that advanced education isn't complete without studying another language. Fluent in a second language? Take a third. Is the post supportive of teach? yes "I've also heard the argument that the pageant experience builds confidence and community among the participants; so does "nerding out" on the debate team or flashing across a lacrosse field. (And you still get to wear a skirt, if that's your thing.)" I find it interesting that you use the term "if that's your thing" here, and support the girls who choose to build confidence and community through an experience other than pageantry. What if participating in pageants is "your thing?" By competing in pageants, I've met some of the most intelligent, hardworking young women in my community. I've gotten involved in my community on multiple levels, not just by promoting my personal platform (Empowering teens to prevent dating violence). And I have gained communication skills that helped me to land a successful job in my career field within weeks of my college graduation. Maybe pageants are "my thing." I don't see a problem with that--only the benefits. Is the author in favor of experience school librarian? yes Maureen Dowd had a bad trip and so we all supposed to return to the dark ages of marijuana use. I drank a pitcher of Cabo Wabo marguarettas a couple of weeks ago and thought I was going to die the next day. Are we going to prohibit tequila because of my bad trip? I wish! Dang that stuff is good. Too good for amateurs like me. I don't know if bottlers still put the alcohol content on hard liquor, but they used to. It was a handy guide for beginning drinkers.....like college students. But then some people used it as a guide to get as drunk as possible, as fast as possible. You cannot legislate the stupidity out of people and you cannot protect them from every thing. But creating a THC meter and putting it on the package would be very considerate. It probably wouldn't help stupid people like the above mentioned columnist, who just crammed the stuff in her mouth without even doing any research, but it would show a sense of responsibility on the part of the marijuana industry.

Does the post support prekindergarten? yes I am a health care worker and I have to get a flu shot because it is federally mandated. I have no choice; I have to get the shot. I would get a flu shot anyway but it does not feel good to be forced, it makes me very angry. I strongly believe in immunization and believe people should be encouraged and educated about why immunizations are important but I don't think forcing people is the right answer. I also believe that schools and day care centers should have the right to refuse to accept kids who have not been immunized. Is the post against state citizenship? no Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly. Does the author dislike school finland? yes Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Is the post against drone? yes Ms Nina Planck ...stated Nature created humans as omnivores....which seem to be she has a direct connection to god but eventually its never true .. then let me tell why we called Human being the most intelligent creature on earth ??? because we can judge which is good for us with the sense of humor if this is not hold rue then we would rather called our self animals..Eating flesh is a not kind of human behavior because we lost our humanity and develop a attitude like animal.Animal do sex so do we however they do not know with whom they slept with on contrary we know.So vegan-ism diet which pure and lucid and it has many more advantage over non-veg-ism as so many has suggested. I am not a spiritual guru who talks about spirituality.But yes we can grow up our kid even with the veg intake that will lead his/her to be better and healthy person. Does the post support proper food preparation? yes Those against the legalization of prostitution point to exploitation by employers like the legal brothels in Nevada, as if exploitation of workers is something unique to sex work. As commenter RC pointed out - many workplaces are abusive. There will always be employers who exploit workers no matter what kind of work. You don't respond to exploitation by making the work illegal. It's right up there with people who can't tell the difference between sex slavery and sex work. Sex slavery is horrible - not because it's sex but because it's slavery. But many people, including well-meaning people can't make the distinction because anything to do with sex just throws them into a riot of emotion and they can't calmly and dispassionately distinguish between non-exploitive freely chosen sex-work and exploitation and slavery. And anybody who tries to do look at the issue rationally is branded as naive at best and cold-hearted and colluding with sex traffickers at worst. Is the author in favor of charter school?  is 1033.

Length of input text In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate. Is the post against financial aid? yes There is another way that our population growth will be our undoing: There are not enough meaningful jobs on the planet for the number of people who are already on it. With our efficiencies in production, and the limits to natural resources, this problem will get worse over time. We do have a population problem, a serious one, but it is more than just numbers and how to feed them. We can make it so large numbers of people do not die, but that doesn't mean this planet can be manipulated so that those same large number of people can truly live. Does the post support hygiene? no Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball). Is the author in favor of bar? yes Billionaires think they can get away with anything in stealing public rights, and their lawyers construct arguments in defense of that theft so laughable they would be failed in any law school class they dared present them in. These people have lost touch with the reality of the rest of us in a way comparable to that of any aristocracy in human history. And just like people stood up to the aristocracy in the great European revolutions of the 17th and 18th century, so we have to stand up to the new aristocracy in the 21st. We have to start somewhere - why not with ignoring these fat cat attempts to block our beach access with armed guards. Is the author in favor of control? no The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate. Is the post against public higher education? yes The only concrete definition of royalty I can think of is rule by decree as opposed to rule by consent. Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason.

Length of input text The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics. Is the post supportive of weapon war? no Having worked at a college library its readily apparent Information Literacy should not be taken for granted and its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school librarians already. There is a strange misapprehension that information is truly just a Google away and students are turning in papers based on Wikipedia entries alone. It will be a very sorry mistake to continue to view librarians as dispensable when they are so desperately needed to navigate the information explosion. As we have more and different types of tsunamis of information, we need more technologically advanced librarians to get us through it. I would also point out that as information is digitized, it falls into the hands of fewer and fewer brokers in a position to control it. The usually forgotten role of the librarian is as a bulwark against that flow of information being in some way hampered or repressed. Is the author in favor of high school team? yes My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Does the post support king george vi? yes WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know. Perhaps in Germany at VW on ground zero? Is the post supportive of air? no Such a move would not be in the interest of the sons and daughters of Haganah, Irgun and the Stern Gang. Nor in the interest of Mossad, Shin Bet, Israel Defense Force, Likud and the Israel Lobby including AIPAC.

Is the post against fly? yes I was a straight A student. I was graduated with honors when I received my Master of Arts degree. I learned more outside of school than I ever learned inside, at least once I learned to read. School tends to be boring for both very intelligent students and not very smart kids. Textbooks are dull. The books in the library and the stores are interesting. Has anybody but me noticed that, although students in other countries score higher than Americans on standardized tests, innovation still comes out of America?

There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change.

Why should I (and laid off teachers) have to compete with govt-sponsored, less-qualified drones who are hand-picked for their willingness to follow blindly if not for the fact that they water down the labor force in a period when the government is trying to undercut and underfund US education? Does the post support illegal immigration? no Brandeis University should be embarrassed to have given a post to someone who employs such specious reasoning. The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false. A mother's decision whether to breastfeed affects only her child's health. Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other children and adults. In our society, parents can perceive that any risks, however minuscule and unproven, outweigh benefits of vaccination only because other individuals have agreed to vaccinate their children and thereby reduce or eliminate risk of a communicable disease in a population. Does the author dislike matter election? yes I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.

But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed.

I had a teacher who taught me to dream this way, and I have, for years. And taught it, mostly to meditators. It is transformative.

Does the post support legal field? yes If the goal is to secure Taiwan's military capacity then I would have to agree with William Murray's point about providing flexible defensive weaponry. Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal. China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard.

I know at work most people I know, including myself, run out of steam at about 3 p.m. If adults can't keep up to par all day, how are children expected to make decisions all day? Does the author dislike facebook blog? no We should have consumption (sales or VAT) taxes and capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years. The corporate tax rate should be zero, and C Corp. earnings should be taxed like S Corp. earnings. That would eliminate the cause of cash hoards in Corp. treasuries, and provide more liquidity. Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups). But look out for the European outcome with high VAT, income, dividend, and capital gain taxes like Germany where too large a share of GNP is run through government accounts. We should have very little reliance on income taxes as they discourage both work and business. Those mega yachts, and mega dwellings are a simptom of the foolish tax laws we have now. Does the post support human self delusion? no Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators. Does the author dislike success? no Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other.

Length of input text First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Does the author dislike adoption? yes I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today.

What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support female empowerment? no There are a lot of reasons that revenue stays in the US regardless of the tax rate on capital gains. The stability of the government and protections from governmental nationalization are one large reason. The military strength of the country eliminates the thought of a takeover which would change potential ownership of ones own wealth. This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here. The rich's desire to return to feudalism where the poor carry the full burden of Government expense. Why is interest and dividend income less taxable than a workers paycheck? We fight many of our wars to protect the investments and projects of one or another rich group or company. It only makes sense that the rich contribute to the upkeep and maintenance of the country. I guess it really is hard to appreciate a five star meal when you know the poor are still eating something. It just isn't that satisfying. Is the author in favor of intestate college tuition? yes Looking at the violence carried out in response to the mere concept of "International Burn a Koran Day" and before that with "Everybody Draw Muhammad Day" and before that with the publication of a few caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish news paper: One could make the argument that the followers of the so-called "Religion of Peace" are so inherently violent as to make any speech which is deemed an insult to Islam tantamount to yelling "fire" in a crowded theater. If we allow ourselves to do this, then what we have essentially said is that constitution is incompatible with world wide Islam. Is the author in favor of workplace? no An Iran with nukes would disrupt Israel's cruel and outrageously exercised Mideast hegemony. Israel has ICBM nukes and threatens Iran's very existence, actually campaigns for war against Iran. We must withdraw all sanctions and compensate Iran for damages from the $$ Billions we will no longer be giving Israel annually. American foreign policy must again serve American interests, not AIPAC or the Jewish state's paranoid pursuit of invulnerability, territorial conquest and apartheid empire in, and beyond, the Mideast. Does the post support public beach access? no "Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race." Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to.

Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where. Is the post against rehabilitation? no I look at my resume and realize that despite having a Bachelors Degree in Communications, I still don't really have any jobs skills. My education failed me because it didn't provide me with any real specialized skill. And because of that, it seems like I"m destined to low paying office jobs as Office Assistants or Call Center Rep. I made the mistake of believing people when they said all I needed was a degree. They were wrong. All I can tell anyone is I'm barely proficent in MS Word and Excel, and I know how to press the start button on a copy machine. I somehow went through 4 years of college without learning anything real. Does the author dislike medicaid? yes Shame on you. It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you're sitting on your... laurels. I grew up in Kolkata in the 80s. Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the slums in the central and northern parts of the city. More importantly, she drew attention to the plight of the homeless and dying in the city. I get that this makes some Bengali intellectuals, such as Aroup Chatterjee, uncomfortable. So what? So her priorities didn't agree with yours. Since when did your priorities become the yardstick for sainthood? Does the post support overcrowding? yes Completely inaccurate. The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. "Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article.

But both countries have to be willing to work together and avoid the easy out of saying the other side is intransigent. Recognize mutual interests. For example, both countries have an interest in studying hurricanes, coral reefs and generally looking at climate change; a particular threat to south Florida and Cuba. These kinds of programs raise awareness that cooperation is preferable and in mutual interests of each country. Does the post support vegan diet?  is 1070.

If a college student is already proficient in two or more languages, then by all means let them study poetry or science or whatever else grabs them. But no US college graduate today should be monolingual since understanding the people(s) of the world is of the utmost value for reasons both practical/geostragtegic and intrinsic. US DOD used to subsidize foreign language study much more than it does today--a pity, and a danger. Is the post supportive of brian epstein induction? no The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation. Does the post support electric? no In totality, this is a false argument for a meat based diet. Being a physician and seeing literally hundreds of children in the US (in vegetarian spiritual groups), and thousands in India, it is clear that meat protein is the least needed source of nutrients regardless of the well known environmental argument against a meat based diet. My own children are a perfect example. My oldest son, having never eaten meat in his life is now a professor at one of the most respected universities in the world. He certainly could not have succeeded if he were deficient in all those nutrients me ruined in the article. It is a falacious statement to say that McDonalds will make a child healthier because of the meat protein. Does the author dislike foreign student? no The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post supportive of addiction? no The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.

Nowadays, we have this magical thing called the internet. There are no excuses for not knowing what's healthy and what isn't. You're either too lazy to figure it out for yourself (and so you let the food companies tell you what to eat -- nice conflict of interest right there), or you simply don't care. I also like how you mention ridiculous "documented" results yet fail to provide said documents. A "50% reduction in the incidence of children becoming overweight." You can deduce that just by changing drinks in a vending machine? Please tell what analysis was performed to come to that fitting conclusion -- as a statistician, I'd love to know. And, Yael, "100% juice" isn't any better than soda. It's all garbage. Is the post supportive of meat? yes Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization. Does the author dislike arm sale taiwan? yes Now would be a good time to begin instituting a serious conservation program to obviate the need for whatever oil might be found off shore in the Atlantic. What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis? Does the post support public school funding? no I am an omnivore who eats a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, eggs and moderate amounts of meat. I love cheese and yogurt, milk in my oatmeal, a splash or two of half-and-half in my coffee. I don't bother with sunscreen unless I'm at the beach and get my sun from walking around the city and jogging in Central Park. However, at my last checkup, I discovered that I am deficient in vitamin D. My doctor recommended I add a supplement. It seems it's hard enough to get all the nutrients one needs for optimal health from an omnivore's diet. The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have always looked unhealthy to me, with sallow skin and dull hair. I knew a vegan who insisted on feeding her baby a vegan diet as well, and that poor child is underweight and I'm afraid to say not very bright. I will not condemn a vegan, however, for his or her dietary choices; I wish that those vegans who do take a self-righteous attitude toward non-vegans would not condemn us for ours. Does the author dislike doctor caring payment? no I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck. Is the post supportive of useful excercise college student? no Oh, yes, the classical "what works in X won't work here because here is not X" pseudo-argument, also known as begging the question. The indisputable fact that here is not Japan has presumably nothing to do with whether tipping is good or not. If it does, the onus is on the writer to say why it is so. Was the author thinking in terms of stereotypes of Japanese workers who act like robots and thus need no feedback or incentives?

That way when you turn 50 your only or youngest child will be 18 and it can be a watershed moment for both of you. I said this to my dentist once as she was saying that she wasn't quite ready to have a baby yet, and I told her that in the early years it doesn't matter in terms of your energy for running around the playground if you are 35 or 40, it's later on when it matters and I felt like after the appt she ran out of the room to run home and get pregnant. But truly, even if you can get pregnant later and have healthy babies, it is brutal dealing with teens when you are going through your own changes.

Does the post support child psychiatrist? yes Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators.

That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around. Is the post against childcare?  is 1026. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.

And just to be clear, Mr. Rep., it is republicans who every time the oil price rises, fan the flames of armageddon, including national security (sic) and the trade deficit, to support more drilling, despite evidence each time from the studies republicans commission that drilling here can not affect any of these significantly. The low hanging fruit in lowering demand, however, can have a greater effect sooner and not hurt but rather help the economy, except for the oil industry and their lackeys, and benefit in many ways that republicans don't care about (health, environment, technological edge).

Students no longer focus well or have the stamina to see through difficult problems. If they cannot solve a problem quickly, they give up (move on to next question, kids, time is running out).

Women with high-risk pregnancies know they need to deliver in a hospital and may need surgical intervention. Many women do not. Saying "We can do a better job of bringing the comforts of home into a controlled birth setting" shows he just doesn't get it. It's not about painting the walls of the delivery room a pretty color or having rocking chairs in the room. It's about informed and healthy women in control of their birth choices. Let us be clear, this guy's lifestyle is based on insisting that women deliver in hospital attended by a surgeon. So his opinion is not unbiased. Does the author dislike private work area? no I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that "Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved." As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father. Someone's got to be the adult in the parent-child dynamic, and my kids, as wonderful as they are, are not 'it'. Mark Gary Blumenthal, MD, MPH Knoxville, TN Does the author dislike foreign policy? no The technology we have today isn't a product of our population. Think how well we could be living now if we hadn't deforested our lands, polluted our waters, degraded our soils and overtaxed our aquifers and rivers. Would the middle east seem so intractable a problem if there was still plenty of water and arable land available; if the population of the region was just a fraction of what it is today? Think of the vast advances civilization made in the first and second millenniums with less than a billion people living on this planet. If birth control had been practiced earlier in our history would we be any less advanced a civilization? Is the author in favor of teacher firing? yes As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation? Does the post support capital? yes "In a culture that seems to be getting dumber and dumber...." "Seems"? I don't recall people twenty years ago saying that the cure for unwanted pregnancy was to ban contraception. Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our "smart bombs" and "smart phones" make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves "by accident" today as we were twenty or fifty years ago. I seriously doubt that even the average person's knowledge of basic geography is better today than that of my grandparents. Is the author in favor of electric car? no Declawing should absolutely be illegal! It's not just nail removal, it's amputation of the third distal phalanges, or toe bones. It causes severe long lasting stress and pain. It puts the cat walking on its second toe bones, which are not meant to bear the full weight of the cat, causing muscle and tendon damage. It's the number one reason cats turn to biting and pottying outside the box. Many cats wind up in the pound because they were declawed and started biting or going outside the litter box. It's mutilation not convenience. It's cruelty, pure and simple. Is the post against deaf?  is 1084. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text In the 1970's it was Teacher Corps... and I spent 2 years teaching Native American children in Wisconsin. When we left I felt discouraged knowing that our work would not have lasting positive impact for the community, but believing we made a difference for individual children. While I didn't stay in teaching, the lessons learned in those years have been strongly reflected in the nonprofit organization I helped found on parenting education. I agree with those that see the value of TFA going beyond the classroom. Is the post supportive of public assistance? yes Most places I personally have occasion to visit, I note Lations are doing most of the manual labor task. Our family recently built a large home in Austin. As we watched construction all craftsmen including those who constructed a large complicated swimming pool area where all Latino. Both the home in Austin and another in Palm beach Gardens Florida I note, all the garbage collection , yard maintainece, pool service, house cleaning, is all folks of Latino origin. I also understand while I haven't ever seen it, most of our frutis and vegtables are harvested by Lation's, as are our meat and poultry processing plants. What does this tell us? It tells me blacks and white people either wont work for these wages, or won't do that type work. Is the author in favor of college athletics? yes I am with Sandra from WA all the way. I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full. Is the post supportive of israel? no We put limitations on a number of felons once their time has been served, sex offenders must register and their housing options are limited. Child molesters are limited in the jobs and activities the can have. I believe felons should be able to petition the courts and demonstrate they are a solid citizen and their full citizenship rights should be restored. Gun ownership should never be restored to violent felons. Just one man's opinion. Is the author in favor of environment damage? yes Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization. Is the post supportive of universal preschool? no America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time.

Length of input text "Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?" seems to imply those jobs belong to native-born workers by right. That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education? Does the author dislike tax capital gain? yes Regardless of what other commenters think about Palestine and the Palestinians- some of it blatantly racist e.g. that Arabs are a violent people and therefore not worthy of U.S. support, some of it just historically ignorant- e.g. Arafat turned down a peace deal and therefore Palestinians are undeserving of a state forever after - the issue isn't Palestine v. Israel. The issue is whether the U.S. can be an impartial mediator in the dispute. And it cannot. The U.S., for better or for worse, wrongfully or rightfully, has a 'special relationship' with Israel that will always, always, always come first. Regardless of the current state of affairs, of who is on the 'wrong' or 'right' side of the latest iteration of the conflict, the U.S. is in Israel's corner first and the peace process's second. We therefore can never be a true mediator in this issue. Does the author dislike europe? yes Most people rarely if ever eat in the "world's best restaurants." Extrapolating how tipping functions from an expensive midtown Manhattan sushi place to the entire country would be funny if it weren't so insulting to the millions of wait and bar staff who work their butts off at local restaurants in small towns where there's no such thing as "career advancement" especially for those with no more than a high school diploma. You present customers as some sort of victims to the exploitative servers bad behaviors and claim tipping resulting from this is not "capitalism." Yeah, you never see a "successful, ethical corporation[s] under the free-enterprise system" selling people things they don't need or using sex to sell... Does the author dislike middle east oil? yes Brandeis University should be embarrassed to have given a post to someone who employs such specious reasoning. The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false. A mother's decision whether to breastfeed affects only her child's health. Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other children and adults. In our society, parents can perceive that any risks, however minuscule and unproven, outweigh benefits of vaccination only because other individuals have agreed to vaccinate their children and thereby reduce or eliminate risk of a communicable disease in a population. Does the author dislike matter election? yes First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life. Everyone is afraid or too embarrassed to say the truth. Is the post supportive of childbirth? yes Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever.

She had a 3.9 GPA, multiple AP courses and 2200 on her SAT. It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University. She is thriving at NYU and she is fortunate that I could afford to send her there. I have been taxes for decades as a resident of California and was denied access to one of the best University systems in the US. Something is wrong with the system. Is the post against baby? yes Since Syria is a client of Iran, Iran is the mentor in the relationship, much like Russia mentors Iran. Iran most serious copncern is the United States and Israel desire to stop its nuclear development programs. Syria with its religious war is a diversion, especially if President Obama can be duped to believe that he is saving the world from Syrian atrocities, while what he does is take his eyes of the ball, the ball of Iranian nuclears. No, Iran cannot help the United States in Syria, its goal is to complete its nuclear program without hassle from the United States, and particularly from Israel Is the author in favor of gratuity restaurant? no I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you. Does the author dislike capital gain tax? no This is a pretty offensive and inaccurate view. To compare home birthers to vaccine deniers is absurd. Hospitals have an increasing rate of cesarian births, which pose an increase risk to the mother, with 3 times the mortality rate of a vaginal birth. Transfer rates of home births are about 2-3%, meaning there is about a 97-98% chance of a vaginal birth for a baby born at home, a far safer option for the mother. Here are a couple facts to balance out these doctors inaccurate and out of date views: From the CDC: Number of vaginal deliveries: 2,642,892 Number of Cesarean deliveries: 1,284,339 Percent of all deliveries by Cesarean: 32.7% From Wikipedia: In those who are low risk the risk of death for Caesarian sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world. The UK National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth Does the author dislike peach basket? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Does the author dislike ev adoption? yes great article - as a child of a 'western-parenting style' family who is married to an asian man who grew up with the same chinese-style parenting addressed in her article - I believe that this kind of parenting WILL eventually create independent, thoughtful adults - who have the confidence and skills to succeed in this competitive world. I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it.

Reading primarily or exclusively in Facebook would be extremely naive and intellectually lazy.

Is the author in favor of car damage? yes I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Is the author in favor of private school voucher? yes Eran Lerman and his paranoia could be speaking about the Israel of today. The Israel that has funded and nurtured it own form of extremism, it's paranoia about dissent from within. Israel is well aware that Iran has no appetite for war nor the money to take on the world's 4th largest army. Mr. Lerman ponders about the true leadership in Iran while I ponder about the government funded Lehava, the extremists who desecrates churches, mosques and those Israelis who disagree with the new norm, the Kehanist mindset. Does the author dislike internet? no Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me.

TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while.

We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Does the post support raising child? no Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money.

All taxpayers pay for public education, because an educated populace is a benefit for the entire society. Homeschooling parents believe they provide their children a better service than the government can. Great, many can. Those same homeschooling parents get indirect benefits from public education: reduced crime, a better economy, and a more cohesive community.

Does the post support miss america pageant? no The only kind of dream manipulation we should do is if we are actually in a dream and able to control where it goes.

They are sometimes frightening, but I see even these as some sort of cathartic experience that I am learning from, albeit perhaps on an unconscious level at times. Dreams can actually help keep us sane. They are a means to process what we may not want or know how to process in our wakeful state. That is why the Senoi made it a practice to discuss their dreams every morning. Sort of like a "Tell me about your night."

Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier.

John Is the post against public beach access? yes In a recent NYT editorial the average executive earns over 300 times more than their average employee. In 1980 it was 30 times greater. The editorial pointed out that productivity has increased by 72% since the 1970's while pay that has been adjusted for inflation is up only over 8%. The Los Angeles Times points out that independent contractors receive no unemployment insurance or are subject to overtime rules. Union membership now stands at around 6% of the workforce. Any worker who complains on any social media platform is foolish. So yes, telling yourself that you are happy at work does make it easier to go to work. When you look at the data the American worker is clearly being duped by management. Does the post support birth? yes I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.

Length of input text When I was in high school I had to study Latin for two years and I had to study a modern language. I chose German. Later in college I continued my studies in German and took up Russian. As an older adult I took courses in Modern Irish and Old Irish. Now, as a septuagenarian, I am studying Brazilian Portuguese. Why? because learning another language gives you the ability to understand how other people on the planet think. Yes, Cassandra, you need to learn how to think but you also need to understand how other peoples think in order to be a citizen of this world. Does the post support misleading school curriculum? yes Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace. Is the author in favor of job? no I majored in European History in the mid 1970s. I remember having to request books which were not available at my college library from an inter-college library group of which my school was a part and then waiting for ever for the books to arrive. The internet is just a fabulous research tool. There is a lot more to it than just Wikipedia. You can find tons of original scanned documents, places to buy/borrow out-of-print books. How you use the resource is really the question. Students wrote plenty of garbage-y papers back in the day using encylopedias (even at a respectable college) and some of them managed to fool the professors as well. Is the post against renaissance? no My comprehensive high school sex education course was one of the most valuable to me of all my subjects. My high school classmates and I were the guinea pigs for the pilot program at LSU's University Lab School in 1953. The course was quite comprehensive. It covered the mechanics, contraception, VD, prostitution, deviant sexual behavior. I don't recall the word abstinence being used. However, the teacher, J.Q. Long, emphasized that sex should be more than a physical act with potentially serious consequences, physical and psychological, and was not to be undertaken casually. Twenty-five years later I was amazed when some parents in my children's school in Michigan objected to the sex education courses which I'm pretty sure were less comprehensive than mine thirty years before in Louisiana. Is the post supportive of news column? no To me the most compelling reason to have children earlier rather than later, if possible, is the current make-up of our public schools. I have over 20 years teaching experience from 3rd grade through high school and GED programs. The correlation of older parents and the rise of autism and general growth of special education would be more than enough for me to hurry my decision to have children if in a committed relationship. The longer you wait, the higher your risks. If you think raising healthy children is challenging, imagine your day is 24/7 caring for a human being who will never be able to take care of him or herself, as you enter what should be the retirement/relaxing stage of life. It's no wonder we are blaming our schools and teachers for our educational failures, who wants to look in the mirror anymore? Is the post supportive of palestine state? yes This is a pretty offensive and inaccurate view. To compare home birthers to vaccine deniers is absurd. Hospitals have an increasing rate of cesarian births, which pose an increase risk to the mother, with 3 times the mortality rate of a vaginal birth. Transfer rates of home births are about 2-3%, meaning there is about a 97-98% chance of a vaginal birth for a baby born at home, a far safer option for the mother. Here are a couple facts to balance out these doctors inaccurate and out of date views: From the CDC: Number of vaginal deliveries: 2,642,892 Number of Cesarean deliveries: 1,284,339 Percent of all deliveries by Cesarean: 32.7% From Wikipedia: In those who are low risk the risk of death for Caesarian sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world. The UK National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth Is the post against woman bikini high heel?  is 1057.

Length of input text Even though I have to respect the reasoning to veganism, I do believe that there are definite risks involved. A diet based on plants does not provide a sufficient source of energy to the body. Without a source of protein or carbohydrate, the body tends to slow down and function slower. Facts are facts. All of them in the article stand firm. Babies need a variety of foods especially because it is critical in their development. As an adult you can make this decision for yourself, but think of your child who needs all the foods from the pyramid to grow and be the healthy individual you want them to be. Is the author in favor of japan? no I am strongly inclined to assert that a thoughtfully structured program be made available to all pre-kindergarten children regardless of their family situations. I've noted that children born to upper-middle and high income parents suffer a diminished capacity to learn just as low-income children, owing to disinterested or ineffectual parenting. There will always be exceptions to the norm--the largely self-taught Abraham Lincoln, for instance. For the most part, however, it seems to make more sense to devote preventative measures whenever possible in order to improve the lives of our citizenry, thereby enriching the nation as well. Does the post support journalism? no If businesses want highly productive workers they'll start by changing the goals of the HR department from parts replacement to cultivation. Find out what motivates employees to work there: it will be different for each as they are individuals. Next, monitor managers: if they go through staff it must be for a reason. Fix him/her or replace the manager. Second, get rid of the annual review or the promise of an annual bonus. Instead, establish annual awards that allow anyone a chance at a big prize. I've made significant contributions to companies where I've worked and seen my hard work go to some hand-picked politico who did little but criticize me while I did the major lifting. The same with the annual review. Simply offer the worker more if he deserves it and be done with it. If the employee wants a review then let him/her suffer through it. Does the post support adhd? no And what happens if this wondrous one state is not the earthly democratic paradise that the blogger and some posters promise, that 60 years of bitter strife over land, religion, history etc insures that the Arab side, when in the majority, decides to exact revenge for all past wrongs real and imagined? The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying "gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable "land before peace" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves. Does the post support royalty? no From the 1948 UDHR (Universal Declaration on Human Rights) provision that "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality." international law has grown to accept that forcing someone to give up another citizenship is incongruous with the UDHR. This did not happen overnight. It was not done in the heat of any political movement. It came about because jurists is many nations realised that it was arbitrary to deprive migrants of a second citizenship but not those who acquired it at birth. Discussion of dual nationality is a distraction. In the current situation, there are better laws available: Deny the new Singaporean a visa to the US. Require him to have a "sailing permit" if he does visit and wants to leave. Et cetera. Why does the GOP not discuss those directly applicable laws? And if the Beatles' US income was taxed, why won't the new Singaporeans? Is the author in favor of harm? yes "The Center for Financial Services Innovation"...that says it all. Looking for innovative new ways to gouge consumers. I did financial services marketing and advertising for years. And I'm always amazed at the different marketing tactics banks use depending on their target audience. For example, I have a relatively high income, while my sister's is low. We both have mortgages with the same large bank. Both of us pay on time every month. But I'm offered special low refinancing rates with no closing costs via FedEx, and the bank sends someone to my home free of charge at my convenience to close, while my sister gets no offers and in fact they refuse to refinance her house at any rate. I can't even imagine the fabulous offers they make to the truly wealthy. Does the author dislike abusive israeli treatment neighboring palestinian?  is 1035.

Length of input text Brandeis University should be embarrassed to have given a post to someone who employs such specious reasoning. The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false. A mother's decision whether to breastfeed affects only her child's health. Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other children and adults. In our society, parents can perceive that any risks, however minuscule and unproven, outweigh benefits of vaccination only because other individuals have agreed to vaccinate their children and thereby reduce or eliminate risk of a communicable disease in a population. Does the author dislike matter election? yes "Institutions will feel pressure to lower academic quality, graduate unqualified students, or reduce services to the low-income students who need a quality college education most. " This has been happening for some time already, and [I deeply suspect but offer no empirical evidence] moreso at institutions that have been struggling financially. I don't disagree that some institutions could be hurt by this, or that a college education isn't "worth it", but debt levels are nothing what our generation dealt with, and the "worth" of it all does not serve students whose institutions can't get them jobs, and/or accept/graduate them when they truly are not [yet] qualified. If a study correctly identifies which schools habitually accept and graduate without proper education/preparation of the student, how does this not serve the people paying the bills? Is the author in favor of convict? yes The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise. Is the post against school budget? no I have in, my career, hired two home schooled kids (the ultimate in "parent choice" education). On paper both looked good, and they seemed to know their stuff in the interviews. But both were extremely difficult for other staff to work with, because they were ultimately incapable of seeing other people's viewpoints. One of them literally threw crying hissy fits when she didn't get her way. Now New Hampshire is allowing this kind of head in the sand "la-la-la, not listening, you're view doesn't exist" kind of behavior in the public schools? Remind me to avoid their job applicants. I don't have time to deal with employees who think they have a right to their own facts. Bottom line: you are welcome to give your child a narrow, even bizarre, education if you choose. Just don't ask me to pay for it, or to hire your kid. Is the author in favor of newspaper? no "The Massachusetts judiciary retains the power under equity principles to reform such agreements when circumstances indicate that they may be impractical or unfair." That, of course, assumes a former employee can afford the cost and hit to his reputation for bringing lawsuit against a former employer for an onerous non-compete. You mention these agreements protect the business owner, but I fail to see how they benefit the other party in the agreement, the employee, one iota. A more equitable arrangement would be to require the business owner to pay a premium for preventing his employees from selling their services in a free marketplace. Is the post supportive of delayed motherhood? yes I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job. He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!!

Odds are that anyone who owns beach front property so alluring that total strangers would want to indulge in it is probably pretty well off, and in 21st century America nothing is more precious than safeguarding the rights and interests of those who are well off. The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens. Does the post support vegan? no The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics. Does the author dislike undocumented worker? no Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's "capitalist" system, where "the man" controls how much servers get paid. Is the author in favor of law? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept.

Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Does the post support veganism? yes What isn't discussed in any of these articles is the fact that governments extend contracts not just for financial reasons or cost controls but also to allow certain 'disadvantaged' businesses such as small business, minority owned business and women owned business to gain contracts that they wouldn't have otherwise won. Whether this is deemed 'economic development' or interfering in market competition is a matter of opinion - I'm curious as to how these experts would evaluate that part of the equation.

I keep looking in the Constitution for the relevant Article or Amendment that declares it so, but fail to find it. Perhaps my research techniques are deficient in some way. Perhaps Sen. McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States?

Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care. Does the post support education? no What is most galling about the advocates and activists who insist on the right of the most disruptive kids to endanger their peers and compromise their education is the fact that they would never tolerate such behavior at the economically stratified schools where they send their own children. When was the last time a first-grader at a high-end Manhattan, Westchester, or Nassau private or public school picked up a chair over their head and threw it at a classmate, or told the teacher, using several of George Carlin's seven words, to perform an anatomically impossible act?

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of war? no Teaching is a profession - we wouldn't want a doctor who wasn't educated in the profession, nor a plumber who was not trained in their profession, nor have a school constructed by someone not trained in engineering. We want a trained teacher conducting classes; outsiders coming in to supplement a lesson are fine, but not the same as a teaching professional. Is the author in favor of ego hedonism? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post supportive of business major? no "If there were any evidence that a state's disenfranchisement law is truly discriminatory, it would be considered unconstitutional under Supreme Court rulings." That assumes an impartial Supreme Court. As we all know, the Republican appointees are on a mission to disenfranchise minorities. That is why they were placed on the Court. Clegg assumes his conclusion, and then reasons back to it. Is the post against high school team? no No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Does the post support obama? yes it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.

Length of input text One way Americans can change their diets is to do it ONE small step at a time. For example, I decided to drink green tea in the morning, instead of a coffee latte. Later, I decided to substitute iced water for soft drinks. Another change was whole wheat thin buns for sandwiches, instead of regular bread. Instead of yogurt with lots of calories and sugar, I now eat plain, non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with fresh fruits like blueberries or bananas. Each change was painless and over the years the weight melted away, until I reached a BMI number of 22. I think I would have been discouraged if I had tried to make all the changes in my diet at once. It would have seemed too hard. Is the post against employee? yes Regardless of what other commenters think about Palestine and the Palestinians- some of it blatantly racist e.g. that Arabs are a violent people and therefore not worthy of U.S. support, some of it just historically ignorant- e.g. Arafat turned down a peace deal and therefore Palestinians are undeserving of a state forever after - the issue isn't Palestine v. Israel. The issue is whether the U.S. can be an impartial mediator in the dispute. And it cannot. The U.S., for better or for worse, wrongfully or rightfully, has a 'special relationship' with Israel that will always, always, always come first. Regardless of the current state of affairs, of who is on the 'wrong' or 'right' side of the latest iteration of the conflict, the U.S. is in Israel's corner first and the peace process's second. We therefore can never be a true mediator in this issue. Does the post support college library? no Shame on you. It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you're sitting on your... laurels. I grew up in Kolkata in the 80s. Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the slums in the central and northern parts of the city. More importantly, she drew attention to the plight of the homeless and dying in the city. I get that this makes some Bengali intellectuals, such as Aroup Chatterjee, uncomfortable. So what? So her priorities didn't agree with yours. Since when did your priorities become the yardstick for sainthood? Does the post support overcrowding? yes Actually Len is both right and wrong. Right in that tipping creates the environment we enjoy when we go out, but wrong in why it does. The people who seek and do well at jobs paid mainly via tips live in that world and it is a world they are competent and appreciated in. To so drastically change that world by eliminating the immediacy of the action and the reward would appeal to a completely different type of person. I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found pleasure in it. But I respect those that do and enjoy both the experience of being served well and the pleasure of tipping graciously. Does the post support vaccinating kid? no Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own. Does the author dislike fema? yes Having worked at a college library its readily apparent Information Literacy should not be taken for granted and its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school librarians already. There is a strange misapprehension that information is truly just a Google away and students are turning in papers based on Wikipedia entries alone. It will be a very sorry mistake to continue to view librarians as dispensable when they are so desperately needed to navigate the information explosion. As we have more and different types of tsunamis of information, we need more technologically advanced librarians to get us through it. I would also point out that as information is digitized, it falls into the hands of fewer and fewer brokers in a position to control it. The usually forgotten role of the librarian is as a bulwark against that flow of information being in some way hampered or repressed. Does the post support tip jar?  is 1055.

Length of input text Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Does the post support air fare? no I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job. He (and his family) have papers (not sure exactly what) that legally permit them to be in the U.S. One clue: He says that he can travel anywhere in the U.S. including Puerto Rico but if he goes out of the country he will not be able to get back in (??). This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Is the post against harmful atmosphere gay? no Arab League has forbidden Abbas to recognize the Jewish state. Arabs showed clearly that their goal is not a peace, but a destruction of Israel. About what can Israel speak with Arabo-fascists? About a destruction of Israel? Pandering to the Arab aggressors and sacrificing the tiny Israel contradicts the moral values of the West.

Is the post against company? yes Dual citizenship shows a hedged bet, a lack of commitment to the United States, as one of the turncoat, Harvard-educated Facebook billionaires demonstrated yesterday when the tax bill was coming due. This ex-American-Brazilian is now just Brazilian (not so bad) and living the high life in Singapore. Greed personified. Dual-nationals don't have a true allegiance to either country. I don't think the United States really needs anyone who wants to hedge their bet on American citizenship for any reason, but we especially do not need jerks to make billions here thanks to the United States and then skip town when the taxes come due. Once they renounce, do not let them back in. Is the post against people? yes I agree that parents (and the kids, once they're old enough--say, 16) should have the right to opt in or out of SOME vaccinations--namely, ones for diseases that are hard to spread. Hepatitis B? HPV? Be my guest--that choice only affects your family, because those are not diseases your kid can spread at school, on the bus, etc. But no one without a medical exemption should be able to opt out of vaccinations against HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, very dangerous diseases like German measles, pertussis/whooping cough, mumps (which can leave little boys permanently infertile), etc. Measles can live on surfaces like classroom desks and the metal handles people hold in buses for several hours. Nobody has the right to expose complete strangers to devastating diseases that are so easy to prevent. Does the author dislike deportation?  is 1055. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Is the post against capital gain? no The single most important issue is 'portion size'. People don't need to change how they cook as much as they need to change how much they cook. My son gained weight when he left home, but when he lost 50 lbs with the help of a diet sold by a national franchiser, he realised that the amount of food that he was served at home (and complained about) was a normal portion size. Now he is much more thoughtful about what food he orders, even from the fast food chains. Try searching on the term "portion distortion' and look at the 2 powerpoint presentations from the NIH. They are very useful in teaching patients about what to eat and how active you must be if you eat the large portions that are sold. Does the author dislike marriage? yes Facebook and Google and Match.com, etc -- social medial in general have put a stake in the heart of any semblance of romantic love. What used to be the private connection between 2 individuals has become a public performance where anyone is invited to weigh in. The magic surprise element is gone because we now demand umpteen photos before a date is considered... yet the art of dating, too, seems passe.. Alas! Does the author dislike public education? no I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Is the post against home school tax credit? no My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful. Is the author in favor of tax break? no "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living. Anything else is just a perpetuation of the same problem: Government-run public schools. Get the Government Out of Our Children's Education. Is the post against jerusalem?  is 1083.

Length of input text I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the author in favor of american custom? yes I think it is ironic that Trump, who believes he can say anything regardless of how offensive it is, is denouncing Justice Ginsburg for stating her opinion. Also, those who believe that 1st Amendment rights allow them to speak their mind about anything even if it is false, are quick to silence others for any reason as long as it is in disagreement with their views. I was very glad to hear Justice Ginsburg speak her mind. We certainly heard the late Justice Scalia's views. Does the author dislike technological innovation? yes Republican support Home-Schooling because: -a) Religious freaks likely to be Ultra conserrvative will increase their ranks -b) People who canno't even afford public school, will try to educate their kids themselves which will lead to a nation of analphabetes easily manipulated by Fox, cnn and the like Is the author in favor of happy hour? yes My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because "there's an American in the room". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes. Is the post against state student? yes My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet.

Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying.

Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint.

It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University.

She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers. Does the post support male obstetrician? no That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East.

Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is.

Is the post supportive of arm? no Some of us don't buy into the Leave It To Beaver fantasy that people like this author think we should all just Stepford our way into. With jobs that pay a living wage unavailable and college debt financially crippling for a lifetime, most young people don't see any good options because our generation took all the money and ran. Is the author in favor of non vaccination? no I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies. Is the post against keeping illegals country? yes I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too.

Does the author dislike impact forebear? no Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own. Is the post against asian attitude? yes i don't know about the situation in vermont, but in california where i did field work for three years in the early 60s during my teens, out of thirty labor workers, the ones hoeing and moving sprinklers, there were only two of us were american citizens. in fact, it was difficult for me to get hired because i was too white for farm work, the black foreman, Art Davis said, and I wouldn't last.

It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague.

According to other comments on this article, I have no use for a foreign language - yet I'm fluent in two and can get by in two more. It's enabled me to work easily with multinational contractors, to better understand supply chains and logistics in Europe because I had to LISTEN more closely when it wasn't presented in English, to be perceived as a good representative of the US - not as someone who insists on English only and someone who pretends that speaking English LOUDER suddenly makes it comprehensible to non-English speakers. Even if a person never achieves fluency, the ability to try to reach across the language gap is invauable as a life skill. I use it quite by accident/coincidence every time I visit New York.

The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do. Is the post supportive of citizenship? yes I think Americans are woefully ignorant of the power of Public Health laws here. Everyone should visit a site on Google that will explain the right of officials to remove folks with various infectious diseases from Interstate Transportation, for example. No one has control over their body in certain types of epidemics such as Ebola virus, etc. They can be quarantined against their will.

Iran is not interested in helping the Palestinians. Iranians don't like Arabs. Iran's leaders hate Sunnis. Palestinians are both Arabs and Sunnis. Iran used to have a friendly and productive relationship with Israel. It makes nos sense that this friendship has ended. The most intense and dangerous of all hatreds are those that make no sense. If Iran's mullahs understood that it makes no sense for them to oppose Israel's existence, they could turn Iran into a secure and prosperous country at once.

We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted.

Is the Author suggesting that Israel doesn't fulfill the requirements for being a State? Israel barely fulfills any of the three requirements the Author considers "essential elements" for being a State: 1. Strong Government - Israel has a history of weak coalition governments, with the major parties hostage to extremist fringe minor partners. 2. Defined Borders - What are Israel's borders? '67 Armistice Lines? East Jerusalem? Settlements? 3. Security - The Israeli government keep claiming that Israel is under constant existential treat from its neighbors.

Was the author thinking in terms of stereotypes of Japanese workers who act like robots and thus need no feedback or incentives? Like Mr. Shaw wrote in another opinion in this series, there are many places with excellent service and no tips, thus proving that there are other ways of providing feedback and incentives to the staff. Is the author in favor of sex industry? no As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink.

And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness? Is the author in favor of news? yes The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.

The only 'brainy' thing the women do on stage is anwser a one-line question. Even the volunteering component is still a bit silly. Given that volunteering is now a pre-req for college admissions, these women don't achieve much more than their peers do. These pageants seem more like finishing school for future high-end trophy wives who are well-kept and dabble in charity on the side... Does the post support native?  is 1032.

This is evident around the world. Sex is a basic inherent need and prostitution will not go away regardless of the criminal penalties. The only rational approach is to bring it above ground, gain transparency, and enforce safety regulations. These things happen only with legalized prostitution. New Zealand is today a great example of legalized prostitution where workers are well-treated and safe. Is the post against handwritten print cursive? yes The US is becoming more and more like a military campground. I live in Vancouver, a short distance from the US-Canada border, supposedly a "friendly' border. It's not friendly at all. The agents inside the building (where anyone who doesn't have a US or Canadian passport has to go) all carry pistols and are dressed in black, even people who are doing typing. I have heard these agents make disparaging comments, based on the appearance of people going into the US. I dread going across this border. I have crossed probably 20 or 30 borders of various countries, including Bulgaria, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia, and so on. None of them were as depressing as the US border. The basic fact behind concerns about border security is, in my opinion, simply xenophobia. Is the author in favor of risk taking? no This debate, the claims of following rules, or of the talk of fairness, this is all a charade to hide what this is all really about. Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here. By the way, in case you were wondering, I'm a first generation Dominican-American whose naturalized parents emigrated to New York legally in the 60s. Is the post supportive of time warner? yes Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money. Does the post support adoption? yes Ostensibly, the reason that the US embassy wasn't moved to West Jerusalem is that the City of Jerusalem is a 'corpus seperatum', a separate body, neither Israel or Palestine. However, UN Security Council 2334, just proclaimed Palestine to be Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Clearly, the UN has dropped the Corpus Separatem concept. If East Jerusalem is Palestine, then West Jerusalem is clearly Israel. Therefore, the latest UN Security Council resolution should be used as the justification for moving the embassy to West Jerusalem within the Green Line. Does the author dislike drug war? no I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it. Is the author in favor of conglomerate get farm aid?  is 1033.

Does the author dislike ev adoption? yes Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Does the post support royal medium exposure? no Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Does the author dislike agricultural subsidy? no My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because "there's an American in the room". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes.

Length of input text I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Is the post against home school tax credit? no As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Is the post supportive of making public education optimizable student? yes "Plant Strong is the Way" - I agree! I've been vegan for over 10 years and I've never felt better. I feel healthier in mind, body and spirit and than ever before. There is so much cultural resistance to veganism - we are literally programmed to think we "need" to eat meat, put eggs in cakes, milk in our cereal, etc. But being vegan is "mainstream" now and increasingly popular. Not only is consuming animal products not necessary, but it has led to the untold suffering of trillions of animals. We all have the choice to not participate in that. I know and have met countless vegan individuals, from all walks of life, who are very, very healthy. There is no doubt in my mind that it's the healthiest way to live. Does the post support whats good one generation necessarily good another? yes Based on the fact that many people without children, children out of school, or renters for that matter, still end up paying property taxes to fund schools in their areas, the tax breaks seem unfair. The fact is that that EVERYONE has a vested interest in the education of the kids in their communities,therefore everyone should pay. Let anyone school their kids however they want, but don't jeopardize the education of the public as a whole, to grant favoritism to a few who school their children in one certain way. Does the author dislike beachfront home? yes Nationalizing the banks would only move them from a bureaucracy that is too big to one that is even larger. If we do nationalize them, at least do it the way we created Government Motors, creating smaller leaner institutions. I would support the Warren-McCain Glass-Steagall Act update. The one issue overlooked in this discussion is the lobbying power of Wall Street bankers that is a roadblock to host of issues from tax reform to their War on the Poor to regulation. Could I suggest that a change in the phraseology from Too Big to Fail to Too Big to Regulate? Is the post supportive of complete privacy child? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding.

In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know. Perhaps in Germany at VW on ground zero? Is the post supportive of air? no It seems that many of the comments in this thread are from educators who are in the classroom, face to face with students every day, as am I. My experience teaching students to use the Internet and do efficient, objective research runs the gamut from those who easily learn techniques for evaluating and validating information to those who can be convinced that President Lincoln was actually a female based on a ridiculous edited photo and a headline on a tabloid from the grocery store! My advice to politicians, policy makers, and pundits is to spend a few days in a school, in Mr. Wurman's case with certified Library Media Specialist, and see what is really going on. The problem with schools today is not the teachers, it is the decision makers who think they know what is good for students because they once went to school. Is the author in favor of automobile regulation? yes The Fed provides discounted money to banks to encourage lending, which will encourage investment, which will encourage jobs, which will encourage spending and more jobs. This process is broken because excess world capacity in labor and off shore productivity is sopping up all of the spending and the banks are putting their investment in risk fee bonds. Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)? This plan encourages saving by U.S. citizens (the kind that breath), retains jobs and spending on U.S. soil, and the increased productive enhancement realized by such projects remain in the U.S.. Does the author dislike fee? yes Nah. Most of our driving is only short distances. Spur of the moment decisions to go from SF to LA only happen in the movies. Look at golf courses and retirement communities. The electric cart has almost completely replaced the old gas cart. Sweet quietude and fast charging stations make the difference. Soon no body will want the smelly, costly, breakdown prone gas guzzlers that Detroit wants to make. As used cars they will soon be all junk while electrics sail along and along and along. Does the post support school librarian? yes Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided.

Length of input text In a recent NYT editorial the average executive earns over 300 times more than their average employee. In 1980 it was 30 times greater. The editorial pointed out that productivity has increased by 72% since the 1970's while pay that has been adjusted for inflation is up only over 8%. The Los Angeles Times points out that independent contractors receive no unemployment insurance or are subject to overtime rules. Union membership now stands at around 6% of the workforce. Any worker who complains on any social media platform is foolish. So yes, telling yourself that you are happy at work does make it easier to go to work. When you look at the data the American worker is clearly being duped by management. Does the post support birth? yes Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care. Is the post against pay inequality? yes "...the need to build attractions outside the casinos...". Attractions bigger and better than the Atlantic Ocean and beaches?. In other locales, the shore experience is sufficient to sustain a viable local economy. Perhaps the emphasis on gambling and not a family friendly environment led to an unsustainable business model, just as occurred at the Meadowlands horse track. Casinos are no panacea for the decline of aging urban areas. Is the author in favor of declawing cat? no The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work. Is the author in favor of single payer? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post supportive of business major? no It's sad an ludicrous that this should even be open to debate...all citizens have the right to an equal education in order to have some chance at equal opportunity, and it seems pretty obvious that schools for the deaf are essential to giving them equal opportunity. So, advocates for closing these schools to cover a budgetary gap would seem to be saying "hey, it's ok to deny rights to a segment of society if they're not large enough to protest". Bad enough that our educational system is inadequate as it is, but to deny a whole class of people anything approaching an adequate education is ludicrous. Can anyone on the other side of this issue lay claim to being interested in the needs of all citizens? Oh, I suppose 'the market' will step in and fill this need? Please.

Length of input text I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc. Is the post against immigrant? no Should parents be given a shopping list or a line item veto for everything their tax dollars are involved in? Seriously? Procedures & materials for road repair? Medical practices in surgery? Proper chemicals used to treat the town water? We could all have opinions on these but are they professional or informed? Parents do not have a six-year degree and teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design - just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. If individuals are so fearful and filled with anxiety & distrust of modern society, isnt that a private matter for the family and perhaps a mental health professional to deal with vs. these private fears being foisted on the general public who want modern medecine, scholarly education, and sound civic operations to be able to do their best for us. This attitude of "Some of my tax money is involved so I wish to inject my own set of facts and opinions with a red face and a loud voice like I've seen on Fox News" is getting out of hand. Does the author dislike abstinence? yes Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012. Is the author in favor of farm subsidy? yes "People who are addicted to marijuana are three times more likely to be addicted to heroin." Since there is NO such thing as addiction to marijuana, the above is total nonsense. I know people who smoke 5-6 joints a day every single day, and then go without it during 4 week vacation overseas without missing a bit. Neither cigarette smokers, nor heroin addicts can do that. "The legalization of marijuana increases availability of the drug and acceptability of its use. " There is no problem with availability of marijuana without legalization. Anyone who wants it can get it within 2 hours at most, right here in NYC. Is the author in favor of taxation method? yes The vast majority of heroin users started with prescription drugs which were never meant to be used as maintenance drugs in the first place.. We're still having this dumb debate in 2016.. Statistical gerrymandering... and no one falls for it anymore Is the post supportive of k 12 school? no The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk.

It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to convey to a customer that a "delivery charge" is not a tip, especially when the vendors used to promise "free delivery". Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: "Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?" An educated consumer should be anyone who orders any food to be delivered to his door. An educated consumer should be empathetic to the person who hands him his food at the door and, consequently tip as much as he can. Does the author dislike agriculture? yes In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness? Is the author in favor of news? yes Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly. Is the post supportive of islam? no Cloth, regardless of what colors it is dyed, is just cloth. Paper, regardless of what is printed on it, is just paper. As long as the cloth or paper object is owned by the individual, the State has no business interfering with its disposal unless the disposal process in and of itself creates a hazard for others. The State has no business ascribing positive or negative value to the cloth or paper. Is the post supportive of public education? no If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Does the author dislike public school? yes My wife and I are long-time vegans raising a healthy vegan child. Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers.

Length of input text I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Is the author in favor of private school voucher? yes Most people might as well get their news from Facebook. Why? Facebook provides no context for the news and most readers cannot provide it either. Facebook news may or may not reflect world or local truth. Traditionally, newspapers provided both news--the what, where and when--and the context--the how and why. That is disappearing. Even the NY Times does not report the religion of attackers and attacked in the Middle East. As a result, ask most Americans and they have little clue that the fighting is sectarian. Where are the facts about the free college platform the Bern has been advocating? Where is the money needed to keep college doors open? "Who cares, just let me in for free!"

During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law. Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake. Only the US Government's continuing presence at a distance has prevented the net from becoming an international kleptocracy. Only governments are rooted in law. They should govern the internet.

I am not a spiritual guru who talks about spirituality.But yes we can grow up our kid even with the veg intake that will lead his/her to be better and healthy person. Does the post support foreign policy? no No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights. Does the post support sentiment? yes The threat to kill college semi-pro sports serves the purpose of forcing the system to curb its excesses. Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult.

It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague. Is the author in favor of columbia college? yes It is an unassailable fact that race-based affirmative action favors wealthy immigrants from Africa, wealthy and upper-middle class blacks, and upper-middle class hispanics, while hurting poor Asians and whites. If you replaced race with income, the right people would be helped. In the current system, people who don't need the preferences get all the benefit to the detriment of those that deserve it. Regardless, race-based affirmative action at the college level is WAY too late to create any significant change. You need to start at kindergarten. Is the post supportive of community? yes I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak.

When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result.

Is the post supportive of useful excercise college student? no "More of the Same is Not a Solution" Absolutely right - so let's stop doing the same thing: Let's stop funding the public schools, which have been doing the same thing (creating curricula based on political motivations) and have been consistently failing. Phase out the public school system. Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living.

We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar.

I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Does the author dislike ev adoption? yes This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do. Is the post supportive of citizenship? yes There would be very little difference in the price of fruits and vegetables if the farmers paid a reasonable wage. They'd need to do it together to not harm each other in the food market, that's what the unions and cooperatives are for. And we really need to license the labor contractors. So that they lose their licenses if they don't provide adequate water and toilets to workers in the fields. No farmer wants a dead worker featured in their harvest. It brings a farmer's competency into question among the community. Mostly, farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters. They like illegal aliens because they can unload the costs associated with hiring workers onto the neighboring communities. And because these workers are less likely to know and object when they are being exposed to pesticides or abuse. Is the author in favor of controlling birth rate? yes Yes, quality does matter, but few people either have the time or money to seek out that quality. Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet.

Does the author dislike us national budget? no The title of the article is "Is Immigration Really a Problem?". As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration. We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Is the post against public beach access? yes Maternal maturity is just as important as fertility when deciding when to have children. Very few women younger than age 25 have the maturity and necessary life experiences to become a mother at such a young age. At least in my opinion, the best time to become a Mom is somewhere between 25 and 35. The maturity is there, fertility is generally decent and chronic health problems have not yet set in.

Managers should be required to disclose weaknesses to shareholders in all companies, and potential shareholders in publicly traded companies, 2. Companies that do business with the Federal government, especially those with defense contracts, should be required to disclose hacking attempts as a matter of national security. 3. Companies who maintain databases of customers that include personal and financial information, including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other such data, should be required to disclose hacking attacks to their customers. Now there may be some companies out there who don't fall under one of those three categories, but I think that pretty much covers the waterfront. Does the author dislike bank? no Evidently the increase in agricultural workers salaries would eat into the growers profits. The opposition of the Farm lobby is indicative of that. Also, where would the replacement workers come from? Maybe some of the readers posting comments in favor of E verify would like to volunteer. And don't forget all the other sectors of the economy where immigrant labor is used. Yes, you can probably attract American workers with Google pay/benefit packages, but the Growers would go out of business due to the costs. And then, when the economy picked up, those workers would immediately move back to the city and we would be back to square one. Is the post against capitalism? no Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from doctors who spend 5 minutes with them before moving on to the next patient. I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do? Does the author dislike wealthy college? no I think it is ironic that Trump, who believes he can say anything regardless of how offensive it is, is denouncing Justice Ginsburg for stating her opinion. Also, those who believe that 1st Amendment rights allow them to speak their mind about anything even if it is false, are quick to silence others for any reason as long as it is in disagreement with their views. I was very glad to hear Justice Ginsburg speak her mind. We certainly heard the late Justice Scalia's views. Does the post support woman 's reproductive right? yes Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Does the post support royal medium exposure? no I think that Mr. Miller is really burying his head in the sand here, to the point of undermining his own credibility. This seems a prime example of wilful ignorance. It is true that the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME, but it comes awfully close. It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama.

What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology. Is the author in favor of global warning? no The idea that eliminating taxes on the major income source of the wealthy is worthy of debate merely demonstrates the pathetic and corrupt state of US politics. Those who are dishonest enough to make a case that the wealthy and corporations don't have a responsibility to the commonwealth of the country do not deserve a forum. Does the author dislike funding college program? yes I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: "please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone." Does the author dislike infrastructure? no I would have liked to end my second, low-risk pregnancy with a home birth at our home a mile from two hospitals with full maternity wards and neonatal intensive care. This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America. Does the post support language study? no I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause "like memory and cognitive impairment"--TEMPORARILY. It's called "being stoned". Does the author dislike american foreign policy? yes Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids, I do know that, having hired two of them, my impression is not favorable. Both were prima donnas who spent a lot of time complaining about work rules, who thought that they should be able to change work processes to suit them, and who resorted to crying and making scenes to try and get their way with co-workers. The public school system was established primarily as a benefit to society, not just the individual child. That is why we all pay taxes to the schools whether we have kids or not. If people want to take their children out, so be it -- but they still still have their obligation to support the schools. Is the post against working together?  is 1068.

If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the author in favor of school data? yes I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax rates on them are bupkis until I either roll over money to a Roth or withdraw from my IRA - which money (including gains) is then taxed like regular income. Conversely, gains in a mature Roth IRA aren't taxed when I eventually draw down from that account. Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates. Interest earned on FDIC protected savings accounts of $250K or under (the account balance, NOT $250K in interest) should also be exempt, and above that fully taxable. This would protect middle class savers should they ever actually see interest beyond pennies in their accounts. Is the post against mexican immigration? yes Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Is the post against drone? yes My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful. Is the author in favor of tax break? no Did Jews negotiate with the inhabitants of the land or ask their permission before starting their massive immigration to displace them? If not, perhaps the creation of Israel was premature. Palestinians have tried to negotiate for decades with people only willing to dictate. The so-called negotiations, with US playing Israel's unpaid attorney, are a scam, a tactic to stall and steal. Israel needs to be forced to recognize the misery they have caused and withdraw to 1967 lines. It's a bit late to complain about the size of the land they were given, and knew fully how the inhabitants of the land felt about their arrival. Is the post against farm? yes The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else!

Length of input text So many have said it so well, I'll just reiterate the key point: Homeschooling is a choice. When one is part of a society, one must participate and contribute for the whole and good of the society. We have long understood that when our children are well educated, the society will benefit. I agree with earlier comments that this is another ultra-conservative gesture to undermine public education and create a culture that rejects facts in favor of religious values, as though one cannot exist with the other. Is the post against education reform? no The problem is not US support for Israel- it is the unquestioning support for the Likudniks and instant vilification of anyone who questions or criticizes anything the Israeli government decides to do that is the problem. AIPAC needs to be flushed out and shown to the bright sunshine which should greatly weaken it's undue influence in our politics. A speck of a country the size of a county in most US states should not be the tail wagging the dog in Mideast policy. I want Israeli politics out of US foreign policy and I am not alone. I do not wish any ill upon the people or nation of Israel, but am tired of AIPAC undue influence in our foreign policy. There will be no lasting peace in the Israel until all parties see justice done. The Likudniks have no intention of brokering an honest and just peace with the Palestinian people nor respecting their rights of property. Modern Israel is an apartheid state and should be shunned until they come to their senses. Is the post supportive of border? no The key question here is not "are polygamists deviant?" The key question is whether "child abuse and exploitation of women are not inherent in polygamy," as the author states. Professor Banks, can you site a single existing or historical example of a society that allowed polygamy but wasn't patriarchal or didn't exploit women? You can't, because there aren't any such examples. Every shred of evidence, present and past, shows that child abuse and exploitation of women ARE inherent in polygamy. Does the post support patient education? yes I have been secular all of my adulthood. I was a kibbutznik. I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said "God does not hear the prayer of a Jew." Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? "First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever" Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States? Carter and Obama try to be fair to both sides, and are excoriated for it. Is the author in favor of woman working? yes 1. This 'Food Babe' (neat commercial!) seems to think that her personal campaigns forced some mega food companies to change their labels. Consumer protest works, but not when it is a solo effort. A bit much self-promotion here. 2. This debate is about one word, "natural." Language is too complex for the debate to be about one word. The issue is can claiming in the name that something is not present. It defies logic to state in a product name that lemon is in the product when in fact there is no lemon at all. That is simply misleading (bold face lying). "Lemon" in common nomenclature is something that comes from the lemon plant, not it's laboratory produced analog. Isn't truth in advertising the issue? 3. My food slogan is "I'm very careful about what I put in my mouth." So that unfortunately means every label must be scrutinized. Does the author dislike religion prosecution? no "It is unclear that it has created a populace significantly better informed or intellectually curious." Such a sad but true statement about post-WW2 higher education. I came to this opinion prepared to stomp on it, but find that I agree. In theory. If high school education meets the high standards Mr. McWhorter describes, and gives everyone, everyone, an opportunity to experience learning for its own mind-expanding sake. Big if. Another big if: If French departments continue to exist. How do we assure this when we have no central, unifying vision for our education system? Without that, I'm afraid each institution will be making decisions individually based on the bottom line of immediate utility. Is the post supportive of marijuana?  is 1033.

Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck. Is the post supportive of useful excercise college student? no No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Does the post support obama? yes Avital says "... let's start with the basics. Any nation wishing to declare independence should meet three essential elements: a strong central government, control of defined territory and security. ". Well we could also start with some basics about the legitimacy of a government to govern people under its control. Without expounding broadly, any basic set of rights would lead to changes in the West Bank and Gaza; and maybe within Israel itself. Israel needs to grant more autonomy, stop creating more settlements, and accept the fact there will be violent acts for decades; let's "get a move on". The status quo is not working. Is the post against dr. evans? no This is pure nonsense. The corruption is easy to see, and to say it's relatively rare is to be willfully blind. The methods of corruption that are perfectly legal and extremely common include but are not limited to: - Super PACs - The straight-up $5000 campaign donation - An offer of a cushy job at a private company when the politician or regulator leaves office - Donor "bundling" - Insider trading on congressional activity (i.e. a committee is secretly considering a bill that affects an industry, and the members of that committee make stock trades in that industry benefiting from that knowledge) There are lots of ways that those that can pay get what they want from public officials that don't involve saying "Here's $500 if you give my company the contract." Is the author in favor of market marijuana? yes The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work. Is the author in favor of single payer? yes It is a no-brainer - of course college sports should be eliminated. They have nothing to do with education nor with college. They are simply money-machines and training facilities for professional teams. Ms. Tatum from Spelman is right on the money: college sports have nothing to do with physical fitness, except for the few so-called students who participate in those sports. The TV and sports betting world benefit far more from college sports than do the athletes. Is the post against office layout?  is 1037. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot. Is the post supportive of helping condo developer? yes In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot, or to remove the plastic wrap of something before eating. I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that. Does the author dislike election? no It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.) Is the author in favor of capital gain tax increase? yes The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing. Does the author dislike internet diagnosis? yes How dare the NYT and a group of right wing propaganda; the two nations that are the danger to the world are Israel and the U.S. The U.S has built an empire built on fear; in our domestic politics and well as foreign policy, the focus is always on the danger other nations present, but that is just propaganda for the totally ignorant Americans. How many countries have politicians as stupid as Ted Cruz who advocates carpet bombing a population?

Too many times, the syllabus for any given course is behavior focused with no mention of the topic material to be covered. I also have to agree with one of the commentators below. Language Arts and similar classes are not academically challenging for good readers because of the need to accommodate those who struggle. I don't object to helping those who struggle but I would certainly let my child opt out of classes where he/she does not learn anything new. I'd also opt out of the character education training, which too often, requires students to respect everyone's opinion. Is the author in favor of bullying/humiliation? yes My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet.

Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects.

If people want to take their children out, so be it -- but they still still have their obligation to support the schools. Is the author in favor of un? no I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate. However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality. Is the author in favor of basketball rule? no "People who are addicted to marijuana are three times more likely to be addicted to heroin." Since there is NO such thing as addiction to marijuana, the above is total nonsense. I know people who smoke 5-6 joints a day every single day, and then go without it during 4 week vacation overseas without missing a bit. Neither cigarette smokers, nor heroin addicts can do that. "The legalization of marijuana increases availability of the drug and acceptability of its use. " There is no problem with availability of marijuana without legalization. Anyone who wants it can get it within 2 hours at most, right here in NYC. Is the author in favor of taxation method?  is 1072. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text I know of too many kids put through too many years of high school, utterly frustrated at the system. Usually they take as many AP classes as possible, or take the GED and go to college early, or if the system allows, spend half days in high school and half days in college. Another one I know completed college at night and summers while attending days in high school.Nearly all had to 'fight the system' to do this. Why should all of this be made so difficult ? Why can't these choices be an available option to all, instead of foot-dragging, paperwork-filled, unending office meetings, interminable official resistance , with insane remarks like 'but they will miss the senior prom', 'readiness', 'socialization' etc. They want out. Let them go. Is the post against dream state? yes No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Is the post supportive of black? yes The NYT recently ran an article about how people lose the ability to make decisions as it gets later in the afternoon. The example given was that parole boards cease giving parole to prisoners whose cases come up in the afternoon, not because these inmated had worse cases but because , by afternoon, the human brain needs a break and decides not to decide. How does this new research fit into longer school days? Will late afternoon classes be useless? I know at work most people I know, including myself, run out of steam at about 3 p.m. If adults can't keep up to par all day, how are children expected to make decisions all day? Does the author dislike facebook blog? no A fine notion, except for the fact that usually a great many people are harmed, financially and, in the case of product safety, physically, on the way to self-regulation through financial fall out. And what of products that only kill occasionally, at statistically low levels? Should predictable death rates be acceptable until and unless they rise to a volume that a law firm is willing to take on as a class action suit or that they break through to mass media coverage? Ian Adams' position is not only flawed, it is morally repugnant. Does the post support public access? no When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post supportive of retired rn? no On our farm I frequently employ inmates from the county jail. A couple of thoughts here, ... according to my prospective jailed employees, in every case the judge has gotten it wrong and they are not guilty. They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks. I really don't know what we can do about this dead weight in society. Are Austrailia and New Zealand still accepting prisoners? Is the post supportive of palestinian state?  is 1028.

Length of input text The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago. Is the author in favor of restaurant? yes "It makes little sense to single out universities from among philanthropies" Hear, hear! Tax them all. There is no excuse for the continuing charade of "nonprofit" status. Everyone should participate in the tax system, and the distortions of tax free status eliminated. The authors allege that not much money is at stake, but the fact is the Congress doesn't even calculate the forgone revenue from tax free endowments. The endowments have so much political muscle, they've been able to avoid the taint of "tax expenditure" for their investment income, keeping the issue off the Congressional radar. Is the author in favor of nation? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the author in favor of school data? yes LOL - I love the fact that even though the NYTimes clearly weighted the debate in favor of pageant supporters, the idea that a beauty pageant is somehow a great thing for women is getting completely slammed in the comments. Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women. We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents. Just ask Honey Boo Boo. Does the author dislike mandatory vaccination? yes Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball). Does the author dislike sanction? yes Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.

This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Does the author dislike college administration? no Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth. Is the post against drone? yes The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing. Is the post supportive of large corporation? no Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly. Is the post supportive of slave trade? no Teaching is a profession. Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students.

Length of input text According to Adam Mossoff: "But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context." But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new "compositions of matter"' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings? Does the author dislike slave reparation? no NO CHOICE ! John Stewart Mill defined freedom as all inclusive except when it infringes on that of others. So, if parents decided not to have their children vaccinated... OK. But this choice puts others at risk. It has been said that certain vaccines or combinations of them lead to autistic spectrum disorders based on anecdotal evidence. Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the "false cause and effect fallacy." And in the present case this is what exactly is going on. And there is agreement about this in the medical and scientific community. Students in high school and college who take biology, chemistry, physics... are apt to learn just facts in favor of what the scientific method is all about. Does the post support trying liked? yes We should have consumption (sales or VAT) taxes and capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years. The corporate tax rate should be zero, and C Corp. earnings should be taxed like S Corp. earnings. That would eliminate the cause of cash hoards in Corp. treasuries, and provide more liquidity. Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups). But look out for the European outcome with high VAT, income, dividend, and capital gain taxes like Germany where too large a share of GNP is run through government accounts. We should have very little reliance on income taxes as they discourage both work and business. Those mega yachts, and mega dwellings are a simptom of the foolish tax laws we have now. Does the post support human self delusion? no Of course they are too big. BUT, the other half of the crisis lies with the deregulation (conservatives) crowd. "See no corporate evil, hear no corporate evil, speak of no corporate evil." Regulation is as absolutely necessary as high taxation on those who have high incomes and wealth. That, simply, is democracy Does the post support health care? yes If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the author in favor of illegals? no It's sad an ludicrous that this should even be open to debate...all citizens have the right to an equal education in order to have some chance at equal opportunity, and it seems pretty obvious that schools for the deaf are essential to giving them equal opportunity. So, advocates for closing these schools to cover a budgetary gap would seem to be saying "hey, it's ok to deny rights to a segment of society if they're not large enough to protest". Bad enough that our educational system is inadequate as it is, but to deny a whole class of people anything approaching an adequate education is ludicrous. Can anyone on the other side of this issue lay claim to being interested in the needs of all citizens? Oh, I suppose 'the market' will step in and fill this need? Please.

Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.

For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules. Does the post support capital gain? yes I would probably die on a vegan diet. I don't do well with ANY grains (even white rice leaves me bloated). That means no wheat, no corn, no barley, no quinoa, no oats... Gluten is my enemy. Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas. (On a side note, I had all symptoms of PCOS - then I got surprisingly very pregnant after cleaning up my diet.) Yes, a vegan diet would likely kill me. Probably my baby too.

What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Is the post against public land? no Based on his picture, I will give Ian Adams the benefit of the doubt and figure he is just too young to understand how corporations work. Corporations race to the bottom in competitive behavior, justify all law-breaking and law-bending by saying that is their duty to their shareholders, and treat any financial penalties as the cost of doing business (most penalties are less than the ill-gained profits). What we need is tougher regulation (working to avoid regulatory capture by those who are to be regulated) and tough jail penalties for corporate officers. Does the author dislike tipping restaurant? yes There is far too much intellectual relativism being discussed in this thread. What was once considered to be valuable to intelligence is not exactly the same now. We need to get over this idea of "well, my kids do not even know all the state capitals!" Of course they don't. There is no need to know something off the top of your head in an age when you can look it up instantly. The information that is "vital" to a person's intelligence is directly related to what they need to know to function well in their field. I teach English, I know nothing about welding. A welder may know very little about literature. Is one of us smarter than the other? Is the author in favor of logical thinking? yes In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate. Is the post against financial aid? yes By Mr Mossoff's reasoning, naturally occurring non-isolated electricity (e..g, in thunderstorms) would not be patentable, but any use in a house would be. Similarly, rainwater would not be patentable, but water inside a building's plumbing system would be. Blood inside the body? Non-patentable. Stored in a bloodbank? Patentable!

Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too. Does the author dislike arab? yes There is absolutely nothing we can do to stop the terrorists.

The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens. Does the author dislike public university? yes I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of war? no It's disappointing that the Times would ask a professional bigot to contribute to this discussion. The Cato Institute is funded by people who wish to denigrate and weaken government at every level. If they pay McCluskey's salary, it is because he is carrying their water. Parents who are not content with what their children may or may not be taught in public classrooms have always been free to home school or enroll them in private schools. Public education has been a smashing success story for America and tens of millions of its citizens. However, allowing individual parents to alter lesson plans at will can only result in chaos and a less-educated population. This New Hampshire experiment will end in failure.

Length of input text True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila! Is the post supportive of school free time? yes I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: "please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone." Does the post support taxation? no Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information. Does the post support justice ginsberg? yes The success stories highlighted here seem to be away from the classroom; why is that ? Because the reward system is skewed away from the very very hard work of the great classroom teacher. I understand that the idea is to use these talented few to create more great teachers. This is not a new model, however; the status quo is largely predicated on it. Make classroom teaching as financially rewarding as staff work and you'll get there. Who stands in the door( like a George Wallace) blocking this kind if revolutionary reform? Da Teachers Unions... Is the author in favor of work ethic? no I think that Mr. Miller is really burying his head in the sand here, to the point of undermining his own credibility. This seems a prime example of wilful ignorance. It is true that the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME, but it comes awfully close. It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama. Is the post supportive of prostate cancer? yes Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from doctors who spend 5 minutes with them before moving on to the next patient. I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do? Does the author dislike wealthy college?  is 1088.

Dang that stuff is good. Too good for amateurs like me. I don't know if bottlers still put the alcohol content on hard liquor, but they used to.

Does the post support miss america? no The US is becoming more and more like a military campground. I live in Vancouver, a short distance from the US-Canada border, supposedly a "friendly' border. It's not friendly at all. The agents inside the building (where anyone who doesn't have a US or Canadian passport has to go) all carry pistols and are dressed in black, even people who are doing typing. I have heard these agents make disparaging comments, based on the appearance of people going into the US. I dread going across this border. I have crossed probably 20 or 30 borders of various countries, including Bulgaria, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia, and so on. None of them were as depressing as the US border. The basic fact behind concerns about border security is, in my opinion, simply xenophobia. Does the author dislike law school? no We are reaping the long term rewards of the 60's hippie overthrow of our culture and values system. The "hippies" are now running our education systems and our entertainment business. They instituted relative morality, anyone over 30 is a fool, free love for all,,burn the flag and pi** on America etc. It takes decades for these moral abandoments to filter through society but now rudeness, in-your-face encounters, ignorance is bliss, hit-and -run hook up romance, are the standard forms of intercourse, public and private. We can blame only ourselves. The result of the Cold War was that socialists realised that no one could beat America with military force, but our education system was ripe for plucking. With political correctness and debasement of American pride and self worth, they won. We have "fallen down and can't get up". Is the post supportive of big business? no See the dream as the journal of the soul. See prayer as the personality's half of the dialogue: the kind of prayer when we, sensing a decision that needs to be made, sort the possibilities and make the decision. Meaning it, building that habit. Then the prayer after the decision is made, is, how does my real self, the soul, see this situation? I had a teacher who taught me to dream this way, and I have, for years. And taught it, mostly to meditators. It is transformative. And yes, it leads to lucid dreams, which themselves are rich and helpful and further, make the soul real. And, I want to say of course, lead to lucid living, with a healthy flow of timely decisions, and the solace of a real dialogue with something timeless and universal but wholly inner. Is the post supportive of free market? no If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption. Is the post supportive of volt hybrid another step toward alternative? no An Iran with nukes would disrupt Israel's cruel and outrageously exercised Mideast hegemony. Israel has ICBM nukes and threatens Iran's very existence, actually campaigns for war against Iran. We must withdraw all sanctions and compensate Iran for damages from the $$ Billions we will no longer be giving Israel annually. American foreign policy must again serve American interests, not AIPAC or the Jewish state's paranoid pursuit of invulnerability, territorial conquest and apartheid empire in, and beyond, the Mideast.

The large majority of teachers I observed were hacks on sinecure waiting for their pensions, resenting the students, the parents, the administration and the education professors (the last two mostly justly). There were exceptions, but not many. Enthusiasm is lost by the sixth or seventh year. One enthusiastic, dedicated young teacher is worth more to a child than many of these plodders, whose influence actually may be more negative than positive. Does the post support kristen semester? yes The usual tripe and nonsense from an apologist for the Arab Terror Method of Political Engagement. When the adults amongst us see arab muslims grant and respect the sovereign rights of others in the middle east, including the kurds, yazidis, azeri, bahai, cop tics, maronites, chaldeans, maneachans, and jews, THEN I might begin to believe that the relentless, mindless commitment to war and violence by arab muslims against all others might be ceased, and there might be peace achieved in the mideast. The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles away from the nearest hostile arab muslim-majority state affirm the general lack of respect that should be granted to the European perspective. Their dictates as to how Israel should be treating a population whose majority supports terrorism against it are wholly meaningless. Bargohouti of course offers the usual bile about Israel and a 2-state solution, and then exposes himself as nothing but a despicable liar by demanding that millions of arab muslims be allowed to move into Israel, despite have no legal foundation to do so. The NYT can do better. Is the author in favor of public beach? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Does the post support veganism? yes I have to agree with Wurman to the extent that "If we are to have any hope of meaningfully increasing the literacy of our students, the solution must lie with classroom teachers and not with libraries and librarians." What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy. Keeping abreast of literature and new technologies that will meet the needs of the wide range of learning styles and abilities within one school is a yeoman's job. To expect the classroom teacher to be that expert without support is once again expecting too much from teachers, leading to many leaving the profession. A school librarian, if the right one is hired, can be the school leader in information resource management and use. Does the author dislike mandatory college? yes They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules. Is the post supportive of misinformation? no When law schools became money machines, the quality of teaching and law schools in general plummeted. Students became consumers and classes became something They paid for and they expected good grades regardless of their commitment to the work or the quality of their results.

Length of input text The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew up on them and would increase their profits moderately if they were caught and had to pay modest fines. No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete. Nationalizing banks would make it clearer than ever that the banks were too big to fail (and could engage in even more risky behavior on more profitable terms than their competitors who lacked the too big to fail guarantee). Is the post supportive of home school education? no That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Does the author dislike prescription opioids? yes It seems that many of the comments in this thread are from educators who are in the classroom, face to face with students every day, as am I. My experience teaching students to use the Internet and do efficient, objective research runs the gamut from those who easily learn techniques for evaluating and validating information to those who can be convinced that President Lincoln was actually a female based on a ridiculous edited photo and a headline on a tabloid from the grocery store! My advice to politicians, policy makers, and pundits is to spend a few days in a school, in Mr. Wurman's case with certified Library Media Specialist, and see what is really going on. The problem with schools today is not the teachers, it is the decision makers who think they know what is good for students because they once went to school. Is the author in favor of automobile regulation? yes "This is a rational response to the challenging economic climate." Herein lies a large part of the problem. We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously? My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with, built a home & cared for a very sick child with no insurance or public assistance at a time when inflation & interest rates on loans were double digits. There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education. So please, stop blaming this GREAT economy (low unemployment, low interest rates, strong markets, easy access, public assistance out the wazoo) & start looking within. Does the post support illegal worker? yes Our school district is terrrible, and the results even worse. Last year a child was T-Bagged and beaten because he was white by a group of black football players. No one was punished...b/c they were afraid of the moron parents. We send all 3 kids to private school at a considerable expense to ourselves yet the money we pay in taxes goes to the school we had to pull our kids from. Is that fair? Is the author in favor of vegan sport? yes Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).

In raw numbers, there are far more poor whites and poor Asians than poor African American and poor Hispanic students. The data shows low-income white and low-income Asian students have higher high school graduation rates, higher GPAs, and higher test scores than lower- and middle-income African American and Hispanic students. However, ss the authors point out, "If a socioeconomic plan is designed well, it can even achieve greater levels of minority representation than a race-only program." "Well-designed" plans, of course, are "holistic" plans that have enough flexibilty in them to permit admissions officers to rig the admission process in favor of African and American students. This is what the student essays are for. Does the author dislike technology? yes We should have consumption (sales or VAT) taxes and capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years. The corporate tax rate should be zero, and C Corp. earnings should be taxed like S Corp. earnings. That would eliminate the cause of cash hoards in Corp. treasuries, and provide more liquidity. Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups). But look out for the European outcome with high VAT, income, dividend, and capital gain taxes like Germany where too large a share of GNP is run through government accounts. We should have very little reliance on income taxes as they discourage both work and business. Those mega yachts, and mega dwellings are a simptom of the foolish tax laws we have now. Does the post support human self delusion? no There would be very little difference in the price of fruits and vegetables if the farmers paid a reasonable wage. They'd need to do it together to not harm each other in the food market, that's what the unions and cooperatives are for. And we really need to license the labor contractors. So that they lose their licenses if they don't provide adequate water and toilets to workers in the fields. No farmer wants a dead worker featured in their harvest. It brings a farmer's competency into question among the community. Mostly, farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters. They like illegal aliens because they can unload the costs associated with hiring workers onto the neighboring communities. And because these workers are less likely to know and object when they are being exposed to pesticides or abuse. Is the author in favor of controlling birth rate? yes LOL - I love the fact that even though the NYTimes clearly weighted the debate in favor of pageant supporters, the idea that a beauty pageant is somehow a great thing for women is getting completely slammed in the comments. Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women. We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents. Just ask Honey Boo Boo. Does the post support travel regulation? no I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you. Does the author dislike capital gain tax? no Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.

As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter.

Does the post support palestinian? no Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets. Does the post support home school? yes >> "Many parents will purchase educational materials to use at home to foster a love of learning in their children." That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means. Is the author in favor of jewish population? yes To me the most compelling reason to have children earlier rather than later, if possible, is the current make-up of our public schools. I have over 20 years teaching experience from 3rd grade through high school and GED programs. The correlation of older parents and the rise of autism and general growth of special education would be more than enough for me to hurry my decision to have children if in a committed relationship. The longer you wait, the higher your risks. If you think raising healthy children is challenging, imagine your day is 24/7 caring for a human being who will never be able to take care of him or herself, as you enter what should be the retirement/relaxing stage of life. It's no wonder we are blaming our schools and teachers for our educational failures, who wants to look in the mirror anymore?

We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Does the author dislike ev adoption? yes In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Is the post against american political system? yes The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Does the post support banker lobbying? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text I have been secular all of my adulthood. I was a kibbutznik. I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said "God does not hear the prayer of a Jew." Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? "First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever" Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States? Carter and Obama try to be fair to both sides, and are excoriated for it. Is the author in favor of woman working? yes I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Is the post against home school tax credit? no It's too bad that so many people perceive homeschooling as an inferior education, and assume that parents are doing it to keep their kids away from others' viewpoints. I just don't believe that the majority of parents are deliberately ruining their child's life by refusing academics and a social life. To the contrary, I regularly see early and avid readers, no reading gap between boys and girls, kids who go to college early (we have a great PSEO program in MN) and by all accounts, do very well in society. Is the post supportive of medicine? no Of course what could go wrong. Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where. Does the post support broad education? no No Thank you. I do not EVER, want my government to force me to inject my children with anything. Many vaccines and eye drops for that matter, contain the carcinogen Mercury, which in later years can present as rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma-like symptomology. And, people still today get polio from live but weakened polio virus vaccines... This has to remain individual choice. My child was allergic to Pertussis vaccine, but homeopathy protected my children much more than any vaccines could. It's educated parents that are needed, not forced vaccinations. Is the post supportive of farm automation? no I like the concept but I have yet to see a reasonable explanation for the added cost of an electric automotive drive train or the multi thousand dollar cost of battery replacement.. Deduct the piston engine, transmission, catalytic converter, liquid fuel system and more from the manufacturing cost. -- Add a 25Hp electric motor, battery charge/engine controller and battery pack to the same body shell. Labor content is about the same as all these components are mostly machine made. Compare with the Golf Cart / ATV industry -- whether gas or electric, the pricing is very similar.... but electric rules. Does the post support business regulation?  is 1059.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post supportive of war? no With 3 daughter's in their 20's I said that too... "as long as they're happy". That sounds great until these "happy" children reach adulthood and don't have marketable or employable skills. They were straight A students but interested in social sciences and have general liberal arts degrees. They loved their classes and enjoyed the ride, but now what??? It is so very competitive out there and when they go for their "group" interview amongst laid off experienced professionals, I find myself wishing I had pushed them to pursue science or math degrees that the news reported were where future jobs would be. My girls dislike technology, they grew up loving "Little House on the Prairie". You can guess how far that's taking them in the "real" world! Is the author in favor of language? no It is an unassailable fact that race-based affirmative action favors wealthy immigrants from Africa, wealthy and upper-middle class blacks, and upper-middle class hispanics, while hurting poor Asians and whites. If you replaced race with income, the right people would be helped. In the current system, people who don't need the preferences get all the benefit to the detriment of those that deserve it. Regardless, race-based affirmative action at the college level is WAY too late to create any significant change. You need to start at kindergarten. Is the post supportive of community? yes It is possible that the spouse of a Presidential candidate, although educated and a professional, living a non-political independent life, would have nothing noteworthy to say about the campaign? A spouse could have strong opinions about numersous topics and insight into the character of one's spouse, but still not be in a position, or inclined, to opine on the relevant aspects of a Presidential campaign. Is the post against speech? yes "Think about it. Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?" The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses. Is the author in favor of child without father? no And what happens if this wondrous one state is not the earthly democratic paradise that the blogger and some posters promise, that 60 years of bitter strife over land, religion, history etc insures that the Arab side, when in the majority, decides to exact revenge for all past wrongs real and imagined? The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying "gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable "land before peace" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves. Does the post support royalty?  is 1039.

But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Does the post support contemporary western life? no I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology. Is the post against vegan? no We should establish a Disenfranchised Index that looks, at many things ( examples include): neighborhood, parents (one or two), parent's own education and their income, family stability and environment, family history around employment, public assitance access to opportunityetc) and help those that score lower as early in life as possible. It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment. Does the post support gateway drug? yes The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago. Is the author in favor of driverless car? yes Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off. Is the post supportive of age child? no "[T]here were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants." That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a "net employment gain"? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works. Does the post support technical/vocational?  is 1041. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Is the author in favor of global warning? no We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries. TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips. Is the author in favor of drone? yes Unfortunately, the NY Times could not find any voices addressing the true idiocy of this discussion: its ideas of "progress," of quantitative "intelligence," and amassing individual characteristics as a statement for "society." One man even has the gall to say that our growing intelligence has prepared us "even to reason better about ethics"---as if ethics were something that could be reasoned! This just goes to show: "intellectuals" do not have the nerve to understand people. They can only understand abstractions. Progress, to them, means cell phones, not less hungry people. If we think that this is "intelligent," then we're pretty damn stupid. Give me a man who can't do algebra but has the integrity to work hard and care for his family, and I'll show you a better kind of human. Is the author in favor of capitalism? yes The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk. Is the post against basketball? no Change will not come to the essential text of the Muslim world or culture. Capital punishment for seemingly minor crimes. Disrespect and abuse of women. Harsh punishments and imprisoning of dissenters. Even much more than these few examples. The only thing that can do the job of civilizing those with these kinds of beliefs is a modrate regime change. This will only come through a similar type of revolution that put the current Iranian regime in power. Is the post supportive of income tax? no Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips.

Netanyahu and Co seem to not care what the Settlements, the Wall for security and endless check points mean for daily Palestinian life. it is well past time for Israel, the far stronger party, to see that they are not victims; the Palestinians are. I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out. The economy of Israel is thriving; the economy of Palestine is horrible. Do the honorable thing. We Jews know a thing of two about persecution. We will get nowhere by persecuting the weaker party here. Please help! Does the post support tip? no First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life. Everyone is afraid or too embarrassed to say the truth. Is the post supportive of childbirth? yes I wonder if Mr. Krikorian has ever experienced any kind of affiliation to multiple groups. His view of dual citizenship is rather narrow minded. It limits citizenship to outward acts and ignores the true meaning of citizenry. A person is part of a country when he or she shares a culture with and is devoted to a country. Unlike marriage, devotion to a country is not an exclusive act. As the daughter of and American man and Israeli woman, I love both my countries equally, and would associate with both no matter my legal status. Does the post support learning language? yes America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time. Is the author in favor of foreign language class? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of tfa?  is 1170.

I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been. The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand. Is the post supportive of university recruiting state student? no I agree. The royal family needs to be taxed and pay their own bills like everyone else. Their decadent luxurious lifestyles are ludicous and outdated especially when the UK is facing severe austerity measures. William and Kate should pay for their own wedding. They are not indigent. The royals could make a fortune selling exclusive wedding photos to the tabloids. Personally, I cannot understand why couples live together before they get married when the research shows that they are more likely to become divorced than those couples who don't. I am old fashioned and think that marriage is a sacrament. I think that William and Kate are setting a bad example like all the other celebrities and other heterosexual people that are living together without being married. Is the post supportive of muslim terrorist? no I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Does the post support bachelor degree? yes If we calculate how much money went to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think that this project is pocket change. While Europe and Asia built their infrastructure the US invested in arms and wars. While other enjoy the benefits of fast and clean transportation, we are still debating if we should go forward or stay in the stone age for a little bit longer. Oh the irony...

Having been in the trenches of education reform for 25 years before becoming a classroom teacher a few years ago, I can tell you that your youthful arrogance is extremely naive.

As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra."

Length of input text Len Penzo writes, 'Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?' This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers. Does the post support real food? no Non-compete clauses are not about protecting proprietary information. That can be done with non-disclosure agreements. What they're really about is inhibiting the free market for labor. Employers use non-compete clauses to discourage employees from leaving. That saves the employer the cost and trouble of training a new worker, and it keeps wages down by restricting the employee's ability to leave if he or she does not get a raise. Non-compete clauses should be banned as a simple matter of fairness, and because competition for labor makes companies better. Does the post support drone? yes Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post against tax law? yes A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot. Is the post supportive of helping condo developer? yes Oh, of course you're thinking of the college students of the elite. Where do most college students live? In dorms? Look it up. They live with their parents or they scrabble to make ends meet in shared apartments. They work. And they are angry and tired in their twenties. And in debt. They are not your unreliables. Just watch them. Does the author dislike respect dignity? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Is the post supportive of student?  is 1066. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying "gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable "land before peace" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves. Does the post support royalty? no Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's "capitalist" system, where "the man" controls how much servers get paid. Does the author dislike office layout? no I look at my resume and realize that despite having a Bachelors Degree in Communications, I still don't really have any jobs skills. My education failed me because it didn't provide me with any real specialized skill. And because of that, it seems like I"m destined to low paying office jobs as Office Assistants or Call Center Rep. I made the mistake of believing people when they said all I needed was a degree. They were wrong. All I can tell anyone is I'm barely proficent in MS Word and Excel, and I know how to press the start button on a copy machine. I somehow went through 4 years of college without learning anything real. Does the post support person life decision making? no Excellent idea. However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this issue all year long, and for this 'room for debate' issue in particular. While the Times deemed it appropriate to ask a Muslim living in the UK to write on the issue (of course, pro migration) for the sake of journalistic integrity the Room for debate should have also hosted the point of view of a native European citizen from any country who opposes it. It has come to the point that the people with the most to loose and with all the rights, are pushed aside, their rights and opinions discarded. Is the post against investment public school? no Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use. Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening. Is the author in favor of candidate 's spouse? yes Since Syria is a client of Iran, Iran is the mentor in the relationship, much like Russia mentors Iran. Iran most serious copncern is the United States and Israel desire to stop its nuclear development programs. Syria with its religious war is a diversion, especially if President Obama can be duped to believe that he is saving the world from Syrian atrocities, while what he does is take his eyes of the ball, the ball of Iranian nuclears. No, Iran cannot help the United States in Syria, its goal is to complete its nuclear program without hassle from the United States, and particularly from Israel Is the post supportive of homosexual?  is 1053.

As is often done, this ignores the fundamental distinction of legality. There are problems that are largely unique to illegal / unregulated immigration including: 1. Job shortage / depressed wages. (Our labor force participation rate is 62.6 compared to 65.7 in Jan 1009) 2. Burden on social welfare system due to illigal immigrants themselves. 3. Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5.

We can change the laws if we need to but lets start with the President following his oath to the constitution and more specifically that clause requiring him to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. John Does the post support patience teaching? no As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Is the post supportive of making public education optimizable student? yes I know of too many kids put through too many years of high school, utterly frustrated at the system. Usually they take as many AP classes as possible, or take the GED and go to college early, or if the system allows, spend half days in high school and half days in college. Another one I know completed college at night and summers while attending days in high school.Nearly all had to 'fight the system' to do this. Why should all of this be made so difficult ? Why can't these choices be an available option to all, instead of foot-dragging, paperwork-filled, unending office meetings, interminable official resistance , with insane remarks like 'but they will miss the senior prom', 'readiness', 'socialization' etc. They want out. Let them go. Is the post against dream state? yes Many TFA folks are feeling defensive these days, and rightly so. The program promises more than it can deliver. It is not the fault of these idealistic and/or ambitious young people that the program has been overly touted as the silver bullet for all education's problems. There is nothing wrong with leaving education after two years, becoming an administrator or going to law school. The problem is that attrition is basically a design feature of the program. An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns. There needs to be an overhaul if the public is to be expected to continue supporting a program that is not successful in helping create long term stability in schools. Does the author dislike heroin prescription drug? no He seems not to understand or care about the damage done without accountability to the regulations, i.e. he's got the trust, but forgotten the verify. Without verification, regulations don't matter very much. With verification, inspection etc, you have something; without you'll just get cheating regardless of the regulations. What we need is more inspectors and independent verification regimes - funded by the industries involved. Is the post supportive of same sex college? no I would imagine that there are also plenty of instances in which a little bit of Internet research winds up improving a person's condition or even saving a life. Twenty years ago when my dad got a weird spot on his arm, for example, he ignored it for months before being diagnosed with melanoma. Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier. Doctors deal with people's health all day long and know a lot, but patients and their loved ones are the experts on what is normal for them and are the ones who know when something just doesn't seem right. It would be a shame if a patient failed to ask a question or do any research at all when presented with a diagnosis for fear of injuring his or her doctor's ego.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality. Is the post against team player? yes The NYT recently ran an article about how people lose the ability to make decisions as it gets later in the afternoon. The example given was that parole boards cease giving parole to prisoners whose cases come up in the afternoon, not because these inmated had worse cases but because , by afternoon, the human brain needs a break and decides not to decide. How does this new research fit into longer school days? Will late afternoon classes be useless? I know at work most people I know, including myself, run out of steam at about 3 p.m. If adults can't keep up to par all day, how are children expected to make decisions all day? Does the author dislike facebook blog? no My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Does the post support king george vi? yes As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others. Is the post supportive of living wage? no Freedom of speech apparently doesn't protect those who criticize Islam, Islamofascism and Sharia law. It's a sad day when it's perfectly legal to burn the US flag, the Bible, effigies of unpopular political characters, but not the Koran. Muslims need to learn that Islam is just another religion with no greater status or legal protection than any other religion. If they don't like it they should move to repressive countries in the Middle East that live, work and think about 1000 years behind the West. They're free to leave. They are not free to impinge on Americans' right and liberties. Unlike other countries, the US must never consider freedom of speech a negotiable right, protected for some and not others. Does the post support parental responsibility? yes If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption.

My own daughter is in high school (an all-girls Catholic high school) and I would very much like her to consider women's colleges as an option. I think they do foster women's leadership. I started looking around for academically rigorous Catholic women's colleges; the menu of options was very limited, so I expanded the search to include other women's schools as well. I can't help but think the tide will turn for these schools as professional women of my generation (I went to a girls HS, co-ed college and law school) look at colleges for their own daughters and see the potential in these schools for encouraging female leadership. Is the post supportive of school choice? yes If anyone is interested in seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, a glimpse of the most likely outcome for this seemingly intractable situation, I would invite them to read Caroline Glick's book, "The Isreali Solution: a One Step Plan for Peace.". The two state solution is no longer viable. The book will shock your world.

John Stewart Mill defined freedom as all inclusive except when it infringes on that of others. So, if parents decided not to have their children vaccinated... OK. But this choice puts others at risk. It has been said that certain vaccines or combinations of them lead to autistic spectrum disorders based on anecdotal evidence. Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the "false cause and effect fallacy." And in the present case this is what exactly is going on. And there is agreement about this in the medical and scientific community. Students in high school and college who take biology, chemistry, physics... are apt to learn just facts in favor of what the scientific method is all about. Does the post support trying liked? yes I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post against architect? no I believe it's true that Prozac along with talk therapy has been more effective than either alone for many depressed people. And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care. What are their mental health budgets, and how do they treat with Prozac type drugs and therapy where needed? Have these countries reduced funding for mental health as part of a spending austerity campaigns? Does the post support marijuana?  is 1036. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Does the post support refugee? no I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Does the post support battery price? no I am disgusted at the premise of the article. How bad do things have to get in this country before sanity takes hold about taxes? The decline of the United States started with Ronald Reagan's presidency and the introduction of supply side economics that favored the rich and penalized the poor. Twenty years later we live in a nation with a middle class that is now poor, and a tiny slice of the population that holds virtually all the wealth. Our bridges and roads are in disrepair, our prisons are full, our schools are failing, our colleges are unaffordable, our jobs are in Asia, our government is corrupt, and our corporation operate like criminal predators. And the NY Times prints an article posing the question, should we eliminate the tax that rich people pay on income from investments? What a disgrace! The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. And the writers here that advocate abolishing the tax on capital gains should be shunned as the moral degenerates that they are; they should be treated as anti-social pariahs, like meth lab operators or child molesters. Is the post supportive of bias? yes With regard to the assertion that larger airplanes carrying more people will accommodate higher passenger volumes as opposed to more flights (and runways) for conventional aircraft (737s, etc.), not so. An Airbus 380 or Boeing 787 cannot be economically operated between San Francisco and LA at prices and costs competitive with smaller passenger planes. Hence, without relieving SF-LA air traffic with high speed rail, our airspace will not be able to handle the traffic. Already a quarter of intra-state flights are late due to air congestion. Is the post supportive of public peach? yes I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies.

Dang that stuff is good. Too good for amateurs like me. I don't know if bottlers still put the alcohol content on hard liquor, but they used to. It was a handy guide for beginning drinkers.....like college students. But then some people used it as a guide to get as drunk as possible, as fast as possible. You cannot legislate the stupidity out of people and you cannot protect them from every thing. But creating a THC meter and putting it on the package would be very considerate. It probably wouldn't help stupid people like the above mentioned columnist, who just crammed the stuff in her mouth without even doing any research, but it would show a sense of responsibility on the part of the marijuana industry. Does the post support miss america? no #21 is right so far as this is a legal issue re. employee/employer. But enough's enough. Let people speak their minds. These are tough times; there's lot's to be upset about. Less repression and less what's essentially sanctimonious PR by the complainers might do us more good in the long run. The point of a right to free speech is precisely that some people's opinions about important things are bound to offend (i.e., really offend) some other people (and draw negative attention). So, we (the right thinking one's among us) are offended, uncomfortable, squirming; get over it. Is the post supportive of hospital? no Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control. Is the post against war drug? no In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot, or to remove the plastic wrap of something before eating. I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that. Does the author dislike election?  is 1048. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

What other nation would destroy its major manufacturing businesses, and put millions of its citizens out of jobs, by sending the work overseas. What other nation would tolerate disgraceful music, TV and movies for its young that features the lowest in human degradation masquerading as entertainment? Does the author dislike passport? yes Even an essay detailing a student's opinion on something must be well informed and researched. Besides being a tool for learning more in depth about a subject, a research paper teaches critical thinking skills. A good student should read and review relevant material if they are going to voice an opinion. Sure the internet makes it a bit easier to find information, but it is a double edged sword. Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source. They need to ask questions about whether they think the writer's research or reporting is itself based on good evidence or whether their study was conducted well. There are plenty of resources available on the internet, but many would not be considered reliable by my professors at least. (For example, Wikipedia. I reference it in everyday life all the time for general information, but never for a research paper) Does the post support income? no Mr. DuPont focuses on the wrong gateway. Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market. Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed. The reason that marijuana was legalized is because it was simply impossible and impractical to continue ineffective and expensive prohibition. It is a practical solution aimed at harm reduction and closing the gateway to other illegal drugs. Is the post supportive of low income education? yes Israel is becoming more isolated and more violent. The Palestinians are suffering beyond imagination. Netanyahu and Co seem to not care what the Settlements, the Wall for security and endless check points mean for daily Palestinian life. it is well past time for Israel, the far stronger party, to see that they are not victims; the Palestinians are. I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out. The economy of Israel is thriving; the economy of Palestine is horrible. Do the honorable thing. We Jews know a thing of two about persecution. We will get nowhere by persecuting the weaker party here. Please help! Is the author in favor of border? yes The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana. It is irresponsible to even suggest that. The increase in use was caused by the prescription drug oxycodone. If took the dirty drug heroin and made it into a clean pill. The perfect storm for a young population already in love with pills. Oxycodone on the black market was going for 20 to 60 dollars depending on strength. This lead the cash strapped youth to seek out methods such as smoking it to make it go further. Eventually they figure out smoking oxycodone and smoking heroin are identical and heroin is a lot cheaper. From there they may go on to shooting it up assuming they survive the smoking stage. I guess the fact that the MDs and pharmaceutical industry is to blame might be hard for another doctor to accept so just blame marijuana it always worked in the past. Is the post against ice car? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Does the post support veganism?  is 1094.

Length of input text I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that "Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved." As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father. Someone's got to be the adult in the parent-child dynamic, and my kids, as wonderful as they are, are not 'it'. Mark Gary Blumenthal, MD, MPH Knoxville, TN Is the post supportive of job? yes The undocumented migrant who stays and becomes a member of the community, adhering to the laws and contributing to the community is, in essence, a de facto citizen. He or she has earned the rights of citizenship in ways that the lucky few who obtain green cards in the lottery or have employers who can finagle HIB visas.have not earned citizenship. Congress should stop the pandering to the fearful and hateful, and figure out a way to define and recognize de facto citizenship. Does the post support worker? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support palestinian? no Is anyone else appalled that we are even debating cutting out school librarians? How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties. Does the post support refugee? no Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people. Does the author dislike felon? no I had an intervention-free hospital birth with my first daughter and a home water birth with my second daughter. Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births. Does the post support export?  is 1071.

Length of input text That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future. Does the author dislike prescription opioids? yes This article is misleading readers into thinking all the immigrants are the problem. In fact, only illegal immigrants are , not legal. We filed the paperwork, paid for the fees , waited years for visa to be available, countless of trips to UCSIS , and U.S Consular. Years after years of waiting, we can now set foot on U.S head held high as legal immigrants. Meanwhile, illegal immigrants sneak into the U.S , anchor babies, expect to have benefits and free education without paying a penny. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Is is fair of legal immigrants like us ? Dear Mr Saavedra, have you ever been cut in line while you are lining up in a busy restaurant or theme park? That's the same feeling of legal immigrants toward illegal immigrants and freeloaders like you. Does the author dislike scientific patent? yes My respect for doctors plummets still further with this ignorant, scientific clap trap. Before this doctor opens her mouth she should research not just parrot propaganda Question everything! herd immunity was coined after noticing the if around 65% of the population had had the illness then some population immunity was conferred Was never about vaccination - which is not immunisation btw Check how many of the outbreaks are in vaccinated children ( don't they work) and check the severity ( don;t they work at all?) There is further the danger of causing the disease to be far more severe as the natural immunity of the population disappears ( check what measles did in the South Pacific) And then there is the compromised immune systems due to the injected toxins under the guise of adjuvants You are told that vaccines don't cause SIDS and autism etc etd Well listed as side effects on the vaccine inserts! America has very poor child health and is the most vaccinated country on earth Down around 197 Now go and do some independent research and try to sort out your country Does the post support advocating home birth? no While I find Mr. Fenton's behavior appallingly violent and highly immoral, I also find the long reach of his employer's arm legally unsupportable. I wouldn't be surprised to see this man reinstated in the backlash. Being a democracy has always meant tolerating all manner of disrespectful and hateful language - as long as it remains language and not a specific call to violent action. Is the author in favor of parent influencing public school lesson plan? yes I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike trump addicted chaos attention? no This is so incredibly presumptuous and racist. Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more.

Length of input text "reports of fourth graders selling pot edibles at school" Sounds like the parents of those alleged 4th graders need an education in parenting. THIS is the root cause of ALL our problems, parents are not held accountable for the actions of their children. The children are allowed to run free until they act out in dangerous ways sometimes taking innocent lives along with them. Politicians respond by taking away my rights rather than educating parents. Stop making our whole society suffer because bad parents refuse to take responsibility for their own creations. If we were to start teaching parenting skills with the fervor of adolescent sports, we might actually make this a better world to live in. Stop focusing on the symptoms. Start doing something about the root cause. Hold parents accountable for the actions of their own children. This is simple logic. Until the root cause is addressed, our continued dysfunction is inevitable. Is the author in favor of veganism? yes Of course what could go wrong. Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where. Does the post support mandatory foreign language course? yes Undoubtedly, ISIS is a well-organized terrorist organization that aspires to damage the United States in any way possible. The brutal murder of James Foley led some (like Ryan Crocker) to call for increased military strikes in Syria. However, we should not carry out such attacks without considering their impact on Assad's regime. Even an uncoordinated airstrike is likely to damped international pressure against him. It legitimizes his struggle against the rebels and diverts conversations away from his crimes against humanity. We must remember that Assad is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 of his own civilians - sometimes through the use of weapons of mass destruction. As the Syrian leader he had a special obligation to protect the very people he murdered. No one reasonably expects ISIS to carry out attacks on this scale. Military activity in Syria should only occur in the context of a struggle against an authoritarian dictator. Is the author in favor of office layout? no Having left NYC many years ago, I eventually came to live in a city of 40,000 that through the generosity of a patron secured the talents of the mid 20th century 'starchitects' and prominent firms. Today this small city and its architectural treasures is an international destination for those interested in architecture. Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli. Obviously, none were local. Does the author dislike school librarian? no People are not stupid. They know the difference between something which is illegal because it is wrong, and something which is illegal because the legislature of a state declared it to be illegal. The more things that are illegal, the more opportunity the police have for arresting people, especially racial minorities and the poor. Dr. DuPont should know that marijuana is not addictive. But, as Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." Is the author in favor of new deal? yes I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody.

No doubt the overuse of opioids has stemmed from the moral laziness of doctors when it came to offer the right care for people in pain. Doctors and medicine is still remiss in developing and deploying good treatment for pain.

Does the post support border? yes Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Does the author dislike agricultural subsidy? no there has been no evidence , I repeat absolutely no benefit to all the various schemes to frame "let rich keep all their cash" as a sure fired way to get economy going. What is happening is the unannounced side effect of starving the low, middle, and upper middle , which does have a powerful effect, it starves the economy. What is wrong now is lower 90 % do not have disposable income, it has been taxed away food costed away healthcare costed away and stagnated wages away [yes I made some new words]. All that explosive growth of ceo salary is not free money it comes directly from all other emp[loyees. If we force much more onto the wealthy thru tax changes we are unlikely to even get a thankyou before the money is wisked away to tax shelter. The idea that this money would be immediately used to hire is total lunacy, the people saying it most of them anyway know this, but saying it over and over works for some. Does the author dislike classic bayesian inference error? yes Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball). Does the author dislike sanction? yes I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck. Is the post against private public education? yes Totally agree with this view, but I have not heard any comments pertaining the posture of Big Farming and their supporters. Regardless I will gladly pay the higher price of vegetables if I new it helps a family owned business. Does the post support valley?  is 1036. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

And yes, medication. Many are only minimally helped, some not at all, but also many are rendered completely symptom free by medications.

But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check.

Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila! Is the post supportive of animal protein? no Sweden and Great Britain have open the gates for recognition of a Palestinian state at UN. Sooner than later, the majority member countries will follow suit. The (official line) arguments presented by Ms. Leibovich come too little, too late. Israel has always ignored UN pledges for good faith negotiations with the Palestinians because US unwavering support. Washington, however, is losing diplomatic control over its allies and friends. Israel soon will be facing (another) awkward diplomatic position at the UN. It will be occupying land of an invaded sovereign state recognized by the world community. A good challenge for the able Israeli-American diplomacy to defend at the UN. Does the author dislike public beach? yes "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Is the post against public land? no This debate, the claims of following rules, or of the talk of fairness, this is all a charade to hide what this is all really about. Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here. By the way, in case you were wondering, I'm a first generation Dominican-American whose naturalized parents emigrated to New York legally in the 60s. Is the author in favor of school district? no ??? Reparations??? OK that means damage was done and the descendants of those who were brought to what is now the USA would need to prove they would be better off living under the Boko Haram. Keep in mind -- those who were slaves in the Americas were also slaves in Africa -- and were under the Islamic slave trade when sold to the Triangle Trade merchants. Thus slaves=slaves and they again need to show they, via their ancestors, are worse off by not having remained slaves in Africa. Then to there is apportionment ... would payments be made on the percentages of African DNA ? ??? or just based on skin color ??? Most people with African slave ancestors also have a larger percentage of DNA from Europe. Thus, only the slave percentage warrants consideration in the discussion -- the European portion is not due anything. Is the post against diet?  is 1064. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text When our kids were little, we made the obligatory trip to Disneyworld, but we coupled that with a trip to the Kennedy Space Center to watch a shuttle launch. We also took them on a driving tour of New England to see things like Mystic Seaport, Plimouth Plantation and Salem. When they got older we took them to the Grand Canyon, Europe and Japan, but they helped plan our vacations and so we made side trips to Meteor Crater and Legoland in Windsor. The kids are now grown and living in different states, but they still ask to take family vacations with us. These trips a good way to reconnect, but it is also clear they have given our kids first hand knowledge and real appreciation of the wider world. Does the author dislike border security? no I agree that legislation neither can nor should alter one's intellectual disposition (or demonstrated deficiency thereof), but what is the cumulative, aggregate effect of such a hands-off approach from our government when the media is so actively involved in pursuit of the polar opposite: informing citizens' views, fertilizing nascent biases with clever sound bites, punditry and selective editing, and even stoking flames of [fill in the blank] - all the while protected by the First Amendment? The result is a two-way mirror, with the citizen - Quran burning or not - sitting in the interrogation room, too comfortable in his or her biases or just too dumb to question the reflection before them. Is the post against affirmative action? yes I do agree that there is a downside to globalization when it comes to fashion. I like seeing people from different parts of the world in different styles. But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect. Does the post support retirement account ira 's 401k 's? yes Golly, have I been transported in time? Malthus still with us? Maybe we could avail ourselves of Mr. Swift's Modest Proposal. All these people are nattering nabobs of negativism. We will adapt as needed and when needed. Scolds are likely to have just as much effect as Malthus. Keep inventing. Continue creating. Some of those who are being created will figure out how to adapt. We should take better care of our planet and its resources and we will. Not fast enough for some and too fast for others, but solar is on its way, our automobiles use less fuel and have reduced emissions and we're conscious of the need for preservation of woods and forests. Whine less and wine and dine more. Is the author in favor of early college? no A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot. Does the author dislike intellectual property? no every once in awhile, there will be a newspaper article about restaurants and tipping. the people who never once worked in a restaurant scream for business owners to pay us a living wage. so in theory that would be adding let's say...18% to all the items on the menu to compensate for the waitstaff''s wages. so honestly.....you're going to be paying 18% more. either way. why would you not want to be in control of your 18%? you would all be screaming if you received horrible service from a waiter who had no incentive to do a proper job taking care of you, and no recourse as your tip could not reflect your disappointment. i know everyone's answer will be complaining to mgt. but you'll still be minus that 18% Is the post supportive of islamist terrorist?  is 1090.

Yes, but not only because of what happened in Paris! As much as these refugees are in a really bad situation - people seem to forget that there is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. For different reasons, these immigrants have not integrated into society, refuse to obey local laws and as a group are very hateful and intolerant towards others. You can either call me a racist or a realist - the facts are very hard to ignore. Anyone who thinks that these refugees will be different from those Muslims already in Europe is dreaming - allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe. It is fine to want to help the refugees - how about the Arab countries in the region? I haven't actually seen any Arab countries offering help - or is that heresy? Is the author in favor of middle east oil? no What is most galling about the advocates and activists who insist on the right of the most disruptive kids to endanger their peers and compromise their education is the fact that they would never tolerate such behavior at the economically stratified schools where they send their own children. When was the last time a first-grader at a high-end Manhattan, Westchester, or Nassau private or public school picked up a chair over their head and threw it at a classmate, or told the teacher, using several of George Carlin's seven words, to perform an anatomically impossible act? Is the post against extreme parenting? no Is there any other substance whose legal status is dependent upon ALL users to be completely responsible upstanding citizens? Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school shootings consumed it. Fortunately, due to Bloomberg's attempts to just limit sizes, I know that the American Beverage Association would be there to remind us that it's not about protecting us from ourselves, but about our choices as Americans! It's not just alcohol that gets a different standard, it's literally everything that's not cannabis. Does the post support college admission? yes This problem didn't just arrive with recent regulation. Long ago banks started to look towards fining their customers as a way of making money. This was accompanied by deceptive practices used to maximize the amercable events ergo some of the regulations. Indeed hitting upon fines as a profit center coincided with discovering that gambling with the free money customers provided was more profitable than providing services to customers and the community - like making loans. We all know how that ended. Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans. Does the post support air travel? no Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Does the author dislike drone? yes The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen.

Netanyahu and his cabal do not want to negotiate, period. So, the Palestinians are left to their own devices. Whatever schisms exist within the Palestinian are for them to resolve. That state of affairs does not preclude a nation state for the Palestinians. The forces of change, good and bad, are closing in on Israel. Tempus fugit! Does the post support criminal record? no Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided. Is the author in favor of new york city? no I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention. Is the author in favor of private school voucher? yes In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Is the post against american political system? yes Who has the time? When the kids are are of school age, the parents - usually both - have their noses to the grindstone. It takes a lot of determination and endurance to sit Junior down for two hours of lessons right after dinner. Further, as degrading as it may seem, schools provide an important function beyond education - as a day care service permitting both parents to be employed. As to the merits of giving tax breaks for home schooling, the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid. Home schooling certainly means higher taxes. Does the post support flu shot? no I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too.

Length of input text Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call "corruption" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a "you wash my back and I'll wash yours" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible. Is the post against weapon development? no I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement.

I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being.

John Is the post against public beach access? yes I imagine that Maureen Dowd's column, written after she ate a whole 420-laced candy car, is the impetus for this Room for Debate. I found that column astonishing. In this day and age of the Internet, for Ms. Dowd not to have educated herself a teeny-tiny bit felt more like behavior contrived to produce a compelling column than behavior in the real world. All I could think of from her column was the old Alka-Seltzer commercial. There are always going to be people who drink to the point of vomiting/hangover their first time out. They learn. And I bet if Ms. Dowd does it again, she won't eat the whole thing. Is the post against alternative energy? yes If an individual or a group is managing their affairs poorly, chances are, it has nothing to do with the way their forebears were treated 150 years ago and beyond. I would suggest that they look in the mirror and recite a little Shakespeare: "to thine own self be true". Is the post against infrastructure? yes No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name. Does the post support obama?  is 1094. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Does the post support banker lobbying? yes In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality. Is the post against team player? yes I truly believe that fashion everywhere is influenced not only by the same people, but by the same websites. If anyone here is familiar with Tumblr, Lookbook, or Polyvore they will know what I'm talking about. Especially on places like Tumblr, where the point is to re-blog photos/text/videos that other people have posted, all individuality is lost. Photos of studded shorts, girls in bikinis, black calf-height socks with sneakers, and YSL rings are ultra-popular, which has an impact on the teenagers who use Tumblr. And it's the teenagers(like myself) who have established the 'Hipster Uniform', so to speak. Does the post support human being? yes The only kind of dream manipulation we should do is if we are actually in a dream and able to control where it goes. The Senoi Indians believe that our dream state is really the other side of our wakeful state and that the two are equal in importance. I have learned so much from my dreams. They are sometimes frightening, but I see even these as some sort of cathartic experience that I am learning from, albeit perhaps on an unconscious level at times. Dreams can actually help keep us sane. They are a means to process what we may not want or know how to process in our wakeful state. That is why the Senoi made it a practice to discuss their dreams every morning. Sort of like a "Tell me about your night."

We can blame only ourselves. The result of the Cold War was that socialists realised that no one could beat America with military force, but our education system was ripe for plucking.

There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education.

This is what FEMA is FOR. They plan for this. They rehearse. They have experience with prior situations, and learn from each one what worked and what didn't. Why should communities re-invent the wheel? FEMA knows how to tap the local resources and guide them in how best to help. There HAS to be a centralized command structure so you don't end up with 25 truckloads of drinking water and no food. Do they always get everything right? Of course not.

How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse. Can't have that happen or the incumbents may not get re-elected and that is the top priority for both parties. Is the author in favor of whether wife hurt husband without noticed?  is 1051.

Does the post support consumer? no "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Is the post against public land? no Non-compete clauses are not about protecting proprietary information. That can be done with non-disclosure agreements. What they're really about is inhibiting the free market for labor. Employers use non-compete clauses to discourage employees from leaving. That saves the employer the cost and trouble of training a new worker, and it keeps wages down by restricting the employee's ability to leave if he or she does not get a raise. Non-compete clauses should be banned as a simple matter of fairness, and because competition for labor makes companies better. Does the post support airport? no Ms Ramos don't adult women have the right to decide what they do or do not want to do ? Isn't it equally coercive to restrict their freedom ? I also question the realism of your argument. AFAIK, prostitution seems to be a major sector of every known human society, in societys with strict penaltys (even death) and in societys where it is legal Isn't crimminlization like prohibition - something doomed to failure, as banning prostitution is like banning alcohol, or other drugs, perhaps desirable, but doomed to fail because it goes against human nature ? I think you are also confusing social class with prostitution; much prostituion is unpleasant because it is around poverty, just as coal mining is unpleasant. Does the author dislike brian epstein? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the author dislike bad economy? no Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided.

Length of input text Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids, I do know that, having hired two of them, my impression is not favorable. Both were prima donnas who spent a lot of time complaining about work rules, who thought that they should be able to change work processes to suit them, and who resorted to crying and making scenes to try and get their way with co-workers. The public school system was established primarily as a benefit to society, not just the individual child. That is why we all pay taxes to the schools whether we have kids or not. If people want to take their children out, so be it -- but they still still have their obligation to support the schools. Is the post against working together? yes The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk. Is the author in favor of mj? no If the goal is to secure Taiwan's military capacity then I would have to agree with William Murray's point about providing flexible defensive weaponry. Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal. China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard. Is the post supportive of illegal immigrant legalization? yes A great step toward creating a permanent underclass as educated people who MIGHT be able to do a good job do not have the time due to employment demands and the unqualified who never achieved a higher education themselves are free to under-educate their spawn. Who needs discrimination if the mom working part time at McDonald's is the intellectual inspiration for the next generation? Does the post support public preschool? yes I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post supportive of relationship? yes My granddaughter entered a pageant to get scholarship money for college, was Miss Nevada and went to Miss America. She went on to college at Willamette U., graduated magnacumlaude, graduated from Georgetown Law JD, graduated with distinction Georgetown Law LL.M and is now a Law Professor at University of Tulsa. She is still beautiful and wise and was able to get this education by scholarships from Miss America and many other honors. All contestants are not only there for their beauty.

Does the author dislike terrorism? no Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off. Is the post supportive of age child? no As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one. Is the post supportive of making public education optimizable student? yes Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information. Does the post support justice ginsberg? yes My respect for doctors plummets still further with this ignorant, scientific clap trap. Before this doctor opens her mouth she should research not just parrot propaganda Question everything! herd immunity was coined after noticing the if around 65% of the population had had the illness then some population immunity was conferred Was never about vaccination - which is not immunisation btw Check how many of the outbreaks are in vaccinated children ( don't they work) and check the severity ( don;t they work at all?) There is further the danger of causing the disease to be far more severe as the natural immunity of the population disappears ( check what measles did in the South Pacific) And then there is the compromised immune systems due to the injected toxins under the guise of adjuvants You are told that vaccines don't cause SIDS and autism etc etd Well listed as side effects on the vaccine inserts! America has very poor child health and is the most vaccinated country on earth Down around 197 Now go and do some independent research and try to sort out your country Does the post support advocating home birth? no The threat to kill college semi-pro sports serves the purpose of forcing the system to curb its excesses. Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult.

Length of input text I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Is the author in favor of fee? yes For Mr. Barghouti, the history of Israel started in 1948. Jews have been living in the area for 3900 years. The Arab/Muslims invaded and occupied Israel about 1300 years ago. During that time the Arab/ Muslims murdered and generally abused the Jewish population. After 1300 years of abuse, why does Israel have to compromise and give up land? Is the post supportive of soccer? no Drones are a weapon of the weak willed. Relying on them gives those unfamiliar with successful counter-insurgency tactics and strategies a sense of security when in fact the opposite is happening. If you do not 'drain the swamp' or wipe out the entire support systems that enable the insurgent/terrorist to survive, they multiply like vermin. Therefore we see the spread of the scourge throughout Africa and the Middle East. Also, the mood of these countries, especially Egypt, is increasingly anti-American. Had we wiped out the terrorists with our ground troops in and around Afghanistan (including the uncontrolled areas in Pakistan), with the correct number of troops needed, we would not be facing this problem today of increasing terrorism in Afghanistan and our troops under attack from the very Afghan military and police. Our policy is corrupt, ineffective and weak -- and it is the policy of the present Administration -- dragging our nation ever more into an abyss. Does the author dislike tipping service staff? no As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse. Does the author dislike working class? no In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran. Is the post against american political system? yes I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck.

This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens.

Why not not follow the morally correct policy of non-intervention....here in may come to the often discussed but rarely published adage "Let them kill each other off" which poses no dangers for us. In the long run, the strongest party (ies) will probably prevail regardless of what America does, so what is the gain in posturing that our national security is at issue and we need to intervene...especially when we can't even figure out whose side we should be intervening on! Is the post supportive of bank? no And what happens if this wondrous one state is not the earthly democratic paradise that the blogger and some posters promise, that 60 years of bitter strife over land, religion, history etc insures that the Arab side, when in the majority, decides to exact revenge for all past wrongs real and imagined? The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying "gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable "land before peace" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves. Does the post support royalty? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support female empowerment? no Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me.

Equal protection means that public universities - which use public money - must take into account how bias has played a role in preparing students for college. Blacks and Hispanics are not stupid, rather, they are disadvantaged in school and life, beyond school. Yes, this means that a better student won't get into college, but that's okay because democracy includes sacrifice. Every soldier ever drafted lost their most sacred rights because we sent them off to war. So, stop whining about being white and not getting into college because of Affirmative Action. Is the post against base wage waitstaff? no We should have consumption (sales or VAT) taxes and capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years. The corporate tax rate should be zero, and C Corp. earnings should be taxed like S Corp. earnings. That would eliminate the cause of cash hoards in Corp. treasuries, and provide more liquidity. Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups). But look out for the European outcome with high VAT, income, dividend, and capital gain taxes like Germany where too large a share of GNP is run through government accounts. We should have very little reliance on income taxes as they discourage both work and business. Those mega yachts, and mega dwellings are a simptom of the foolish tax laws we have now. Does the post support human self delusion? no As the 61 year old parent of two late 20 year olds I think all the helicopter parents here who think they can monitor their kids to the nth degree and not destroy the relationship are out of their minds. In particular "I have the gold I make the rules" is the relationship of master and servant. If you want your kids to quit school and be waitresses or bartenders to get you off their back keep repeating "i own you until you pay your own bills". If you want a lawyer, a Doctor an MBA or a Phd in the family you have to learn to respect their autonomy while still providing support. Respect for autonomy starts early and grows as the child grows. The years between 13 and 18 are critical. The child has to learn self control and you have to learn to let go and respect your childs autonomy. Otherwise there is an explosion when they hit 18 Is the author in favor of business? yes It is quite sad to see a doctor advocate for government coercion for something that every doctor acknowledges has its risks. How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines. Does the post support work? no People who are in the habit of behaving with civility tend not to commit minor crimes and to not disrespect the lives of others. Police work that enforces minor offenses and quality of life ordinances sends the message that uncivil behavior will not be tolerated. Some in poorly policed areas are characterized by a lot of people who live in distress, are exposed to criminal behavior on a daily basis, and are exposed to significant numbers of people who are used to acting out without any consequences. In such areas the worst behaving people end up determining the living conditions of all. Is the author in favor of economy? no Forget the cruise missiles and air strikes without any real full scale attacks which threaten the target country's ability to conduct the egregious acts. All those do is destroy some buildings and kill more bystanders than malefactors. If we participate in any intervention it must be as a part of a significant and broad coalition. So far the U.N. inspectors have not been allowed to inspect. This must be made into a big issue both for Assad's people and for any others who are impeding the inspectors. It is important for the world to know who is doing who to who, here. We must remember that Assad is the leader of a dominant minority, not just some singular tyrant, and bringing him down means exposing that minority to the kinds of sectarian reprisals we saw in Iraq after Saddam was crushed, and that it absorbed our strategic land forces for over five years. That is not the way to go. Is the post supportive of law study?  is 1051. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text Based on the fact that many people without children, children out of school, or renters for that matter, still end up paying property taxes to fund schools in their areas, the tax breaks seem unfair. The fact is that that EVERYONE has a vested interest in the education of the kids in their communities,therefore everyone should pay. Let anyone school their kids however they want, but don't jeopardize the education of the public as a whole, to grant favoritism to a few who school their children in one certain way. Does the author dislike beachfront home? yes Conservatives often claim that taxing capital gains is double taxation. This is a fallacy and a myth. People and corporations are taxed only on their earnings. So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits. However, if most of the corporate profits were in the form of capital gains, then it may smarter to take the income as profits (two 15% tax rates results in an effective tax rate of 27.75%). Does the author dislike people? yes Republican support Home-Schooling because: -a) Religious freaks likely to be Ultra conserrvative will increase their ranks -b) People who canno't even afford public school, will try to educate their kids themselves which will lead to a nation of analphabetes easily manipulated by Fox, cnn and the like Is the author in favor of medium outlet? yes great article - as a child of a 'western-parenting style' family who is married to an asian man who grew up with the same chinese-style parenting addressed in her article - I believe that this kind of parenting WILL eventually create independent, thoughtful adults - who have the confidence and skills to succeed in this competitive world. I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it. Does the author dislike bad argument? yes Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me. Does the author dislike drone? yes If the goal is to secure Taiwan's military capacity then I would have to agree with William Murray's point about providing flexible defensive weaponry. Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal. China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard.

Length of input text "[T]here were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants." That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a "net employment gain"? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works. Does the post support technical/vocational? no "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Does the post support machine use? yes I suspect the real world performance of these batteries will be less than advertised. How will the Leaf do on a 95 degree summer afternoon in Houston with the a/c going full tilt and you are stuck in a freeway traffic jam for 90 minutes which frequently happens in all large cities? How will the Leaf do on -35 degree winter morning in Minneapolis and your commute is 25 miles each way and your place of work has only outdoor parking where the battery will remain well below zero and there is no recharging facility? Battery technology for the most part is stuck and until a breakthrough occurs in this area EV cars are a tiny niche. Is the post against college student? yes I think this is a problem for most big cities like New York, Chicago, LA., Toronto and Montreal...and like is so often in these big cities money works for the wealthy. It buys great medical care, great dental care and great dinners. I come from the land of Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon and I can see myself buying a table at the last minute but if I don't care when I eat there then I will simply wait for an OpenTable or call. But then again our restaurants tend to be on the smaller size more petite size. Sometimes it take being a Chef to get into some of them. Does the post support globalization? yes As Caroline Glicks less than artful use of quotation marks demonstrates, many people, especially Israelis are unwilling to even recognize the existence of the Palestinian people, let alone state. Much easier to appropriate land and refuse to respect anothers basic human rights if you refuse to admit they are even there, or fully human. First and foremost should be the full recognition that a people can be defined by any name they choose and have the right to a voice in establishing their future and a right to equal status under the law. Just as the fact there was no Israel, or Israelis 100 years ago doesn't negate that nations right to self determination, so the same should be for the Palestinians. Nations should recognize the Palestinian people and their right to not be held in legal limbo. Hillel said "That which is despicable to you, do not do to your fellow, this is the whole Torah, and the rest is commentary, go and learn it." It is despicable to me that one people can hold dominion over another. That needs to end, all the rest is just details. Is the post supportive of public service? yes I think it is ironic that Trump, who believes he can say anything regardless of how offensive it is, is denouncing Justice Ginsburg for stating her opinion. Also, those who believe that 1st Amendment rights allow them to speak their mind about anything even if it is false, are quick to silence others for any reason as long as it is in disagreement with their views. I was very glad to hear Justice Ginsburg speak her mind. We certainly heard the late Justice Scalia's views. Does the author dislike ian adam?  is 1042. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

None of the people I know, not one of them, who smoke joint have any inclination toward using harder drugs. I've never tried pot brownies but perhaps I'd like them better than smoking which cannot be good for my lungs. My sense is people who use hard drugs are predisposed to their use and not pushed along by toking on a pipe of mary jane. I feel strongly that commentaries such as this written by people in positions affecting laws mislead and in turn do much more harm than good. Does the post support migrant worker? yes Marketplace regulation, or regulation by natural fallout of consequences in the marketplace, actually requires a company to victimize the public, before being caught out doing it. Certainly we can decide that some things the public can choose for themselves - unhealthy food, cars that chew up more gas for instance. But do we let the company take our money for a product that is not as advertised? Do we allow truck drivers to drive until they fall asleep at the wheel? Do we allow car manufacturers to produce cars that kill customers, and not require that they investigate and report on it? Do we allow companies to dump toxic metals in people's water supply? Do we allow companies to ship us salmonella and e coli as a matter of course? Or sell drugs that are untested? We regulate to protect people before they become victims, and to give people recourse once they are victimized. It is only common sense. Does the author dislike ignorance? yes I would imagine that there are also plenty of instances in which a little bit of Internet research winds up improving a person's condition or even saving a life. Twenty years ago when my dad got a weird spot on his arm, for example, he ignored it for months before being diagnosed with melanoma. Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier. Doctors deal with people's health all day long and know a lot, but patients and their loved ones are the experts on what is normal for them and are the ones who know when something just doesn't seem right. It would be a shame if a patient failed to ask a question or do any research at all when presented with a diagnosis for fear of injuring his or her doctor's ego. Does the author dislike capital? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the post support female empowerment? no I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed. For the record I don't have kids and am not religious at all. Is the post against architect? no I listened to the NPR Diane Rehm interview with Ms. Chua. She was asked if she would do anything differently now. She replied that she would give her daughters more choices. An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad. All I can say is that I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play, nor did I stand over them while they practiced.

How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines. Is the post supportive of worthy habit self control? yes Look at the human species not other animal species. It's not vegies and whole foods that make a major portion of Western diet eaters overweightt and obese. It's not vegies that puts a major portion of the US population on statins to reduce bad cholesterol. It's not vegies that are helping to raise medical costs to astronomical heights.Perhaps a major portion of the problem lies in the high animal fat Western diet. Is the post supportive of u.k. monarchy? yes The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups. Does the author dislike beauty gadget? yes As a cancer survivor (14 years in remission after an aggressive lymphoma treated with Chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy) I am happy to say that I made very extensive use of the Google during my treatment. It obviously doesn't replace or 'outrank' my specialists, but I found it was a big help in educating me and filling in background info on my situation and the treatment options that were being recommended. I believe researching options online helped me to ask better questions and ultimately made me a lot more comfortable with the treatment plan my doctors recommended. In most cases, the information I found online agreed with what the docs were telling me. I found that to be very comforting because I didn't just feel like I was taking everything the docs said on blind faith and at face value. In at least 2 cases, the questions I asked did lead to changes in my treatment plan. Is the post against hamas fatah unity? yes Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the post against cherrypicking student? no Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.

Length of input text The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept. Is the post against company? yes The problem is not US support for Israel- it is the unquestioning support for the Likudniks and instant vilification of anyone who questions or criticizes anything the Israeli government decides to do that is the problem. AIPAC needs to be flushed out and shown to the bright sunshine which should greatly weaken it's undue influence in our politics. A speck of a country the size of a county in most US states should not be the tail wagging the dog in Mideast policy. I want Israeli politics out of US foreign policy and I am not alone. I do not wish any ill upon the people or nation of Israel, but am tired of AIPAC undue influence in our foreign policy. There will be no lasting peace in the Israel until all parties see justice done. The Likudniks have no intention of brokering an honest and just peace with the Palestinian people nor respecting their rights of property. Modern Israel is an apartheid state and should be shunned until they come to their senses. Is the post supportive of border? no What I would like to see is the responsibility for raising children to be the PARENT"S job once again. It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need. I would homeschool but I need to work to pay my school taxes which have quadrupled in the past six years. Social skills learned in school? Seems like I spend every waking moment trying to undo the social skills my daughter is "learning" during school hours! Does the author dislike emigration? no Personally I think airlines don't care about any of their workers. They most certainly don't care about the flying public/customer. This is reflected in the faces of all who are shoehorned and buckled into tiny seats. Like all other jobs today we humans are disposable workers, flight attendants included. I can handle a surly or neglectful attendant on occasion for it is a tough, demanding position but we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots. This worries me tremendously having worked for the airlines in the past. These mostly highly trained professionals are being abused and not paid decently. Don't get me wrong cabin crews are important but the person in the cockpit can not be marginalized or treated poorly. I think we can all agree that safe, happy and well rested and trained pilots are crucial to the business. Is the post supportive of wealthy immigrant? no the q'uran has no special standing in us law. I am sorry that some are offended, but to force the world of infidels (myself included) to defer to the religious sensibilities of others when no other crime has been committed is an atrocity against REASON. as long as it was his book, and no fire codes were violated it is simply no business of the public. There is no caliphate in place here. Is the post against drone strike? no One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards and prevent people who have the interest and learning to keep the schools funded and educating students well from serving on the Boards. These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts.

" This has been happening for some time already, and [I deeply suspect but offer no empirical evidence] moreso at institutions that have been struggling financially. I don't disagree that some institutions could be hurt by this, or that a college education isn't "worth it", but debt levels are nothing what our generation dealt with, and the "worth" of it all does not serve students whose institutions can't get them jobs, and/or accept/graduate them when they truly are not [yet] qualified. If a study correctly identifies which schools habitually accept and graduate without proper education/preparation of the student, how does this not serve the people paying the bills? Is the author in favor of convict? yes Ranking, per se, is unnecessary, and it would force colleges and induce students to focus on a single score rather than education. But more information is needed about the value of the educational experience each college provides. The government would do well to develop indexes of various kinds of student achievement. Perhaps five or ten indexes, uniformly scaled 0 to 10 or 0 100, would each measure an important aspect of a college's student body's performance. It would not be necessary to rank-order colleges, because each of the 5 or 10 scores would use the same standardized scale. Is the post supportive of capital gain? no My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children of the active PTA parents were receiving all the awards, and maybe some people would find that wrong, replied, "It just proves that parental involvement equals student achievement." When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, "We weren't offered any other options." When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal. Does the author dislike mother teresa? yes The US is becoming more and more like a military campground. I live in Vancouver, a short distance from the US-Canada border, supposedly a "friendly' border. It's not friendly at all. The agents inside the building (where anyone who doesn't have a US or Canadian passport has to go) all carry pistols and are dressed in black, even people who are doing typing. I have heard these agents make disparaging comments, based on the appearance of people going into the US. I dread going across this border. I have crossed probably 20 or 30 borders of various countries, including Bulgaria, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia, and so on. None of them were as depressing as the US border. The basic fact behind concerns about border security is, in my opinion, simply xenophobia. Does the author dislike law school? no I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Is the author in favor of fee? yes I am embarrassed for the N Y Times for giving any space to this tired old myth. It is time for the Times to make a stand for the truth.

Length of input text I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate. However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality. Is the author in favor of basketball rule? no As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others. Does the author dislike aba approved law school? no Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint. Is the author in favor of property tax? no I met a great guy named Oscar yesterday, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 6, born in 1988 so he is 27 today. He works full time at a steady job.

I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do? Does the author dislike wealthy college? no I agree with McCluskey. It is unconstitutional intrusion. If Republicans back the idea, they definitely have not gotten the message. The federal government should not be financing education, either directly through grants or indirectly through tax credits. Education is a 100% responsibility and obligation of the states.

Length of input text If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Does the author dislike school? no My wife and I are long-time vegans raising a healthy vegan child. Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers. Is the post supportive of immigration issue? no What position is the "British Ambassador to Tel Aviv"? I didn't know there were ambassadors to cities. Is this a non-recognition of Israel as a state?

Is the post against canada? no Israel is becoming more isolated and more violent. The Palestinians are suffering beyond imagination. Netanyahu and Co seem to not care what the Settlements, the Wall for security and endless check points mean for daily Palestinian life. it is well past time for Israel, the far stronger party, to see that they are not victims; the Palestinians are. I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out. The economy of Israel is thriving; the economy of Palestine is horrible. Do the honorable thing. We Jews know a thing of two about persecution. We will get nowhere by persecuting the weaker party here. Please help! Does the post support tip? no Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012. Is the author in favor of farm subsidy? yes Golly, have I been transported in time? Malthus still with us?

In raw numbers, there are far more poor whites and poor Asians than poor African American and poor Hispanic students. The data shows low-income white and low-income Asian students have higher high school graduation rates, higher GPAs, and higher test scores than lower- and middle-income African American and Hispanic students. However, ss the authors point out, "If a socioeconomic plan is designed well, it can even achieve greater levels of minority representation than a race-only program." "Well-designed" plans, of course, are "holistic" plans that have enough flexibilty in them to permit admissions officers to rig the admission process in favor of African and American students. This is what the student essays are for. Is the author in favor of cat declawing? yes I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the author in favor of american custom? yes Of course what could go wrong. Hamas is just like any other political group peace loving and giving! What a fantasy. And I like the way peace is always about finding. Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt. Israel has not always been right but there are a lot of bad actors here so lets be fair and we might get some where. Is the post against rehabilitation? no A great article. Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond proving the scientific information in the article to be wrong, it will be very difficult to come to another conclusion than the author arrives at. Vegetarianism and veganism are mainly moralistic choices of life style, and should be presented as such. But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children. Is the post supportive of medical website? no Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips. Is the post supportive of wait staff? yes Employees should be free to move or sell their talents to the highest bidder. A time restricted none compete that's enforced through compensation by the former employer who wishes to restrict the employee seems like reasonable protection for both sides. The employee can't work for a year or two in their most lucrative field but the employer who wishes to restrict them pays them a portion of their lost wages for the period of enforcement. A free market for goods and services includes labor. A none compete does more than protect intellectual property it suppresses wages and creates a sense that the employee is property of the employer if they wish to stay in the field were they have the most experience and potential value.

The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Does the post support banker lobbying? yes A retired teacher who observed, and often mentored, many Teach for America teachers, I whole-heartedly support Ms. Crocco's observations. In what other profession would it be assumed that minimal training, no matter how well-educated one happens to be, is sufficient to enter the field: law, medicine? The fact we not only allow it, but encourage such an approach in eduction to me says a great deal about how teaching is viewed in this country, that is, it is not truly a profession. One will never build a first-class educational system based on this widely held conviction. For further thoughts, I refer the reader to the book by Diane Ravitch (one of the best historians of American schools) The Death and Life of the Great American School system. Does the author dislike benefit technology? yes How about obstetricians step up and admit that since men started controlling the birth process in hospital, women have suffered. Unneeded interventions and drugs, artificially induced labours, humiliating practices like shaving pubic hair, twilight sleep, episiotomies, Caesareans scheduled for the convenience of the doctor and his golf game, women with previous Caesareans not allowed to attempt a VBAC, babies and mothers separated at birth. If you're wondering why some women would want a home birth, take a look at yourselves and your practices. Is the author in favor of funding college program? yes There is no economic argument for taxing income differently, depending on its source; income is income. Such arguments as we typically hear are theological debates, whose partisans hope to pave their way to a personal vision of heaven. The double taxation argument is groundless; in the first case there are many other examples of double taxation, and in the second empirical evidence does not support conservative claims about disincentives. One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it? From a strict economic viewpoint, all income should be taxed equally. This would avoid the huge incentives - and wasted, non-productive investments - in gaming the system, that firms and investors routinely make. The opportunity costs of those activities are literally mind boggling - but never discussed. Is the post against upbringing? yes I think this is absolutely wrong that he was fired. What he burned was nothing more than a 'symbol", albeit a very important one to some people. Should people be fired for burning a country's flag? What about an image of Obama? Or an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Should people be fired for writing an Editorial that says bad things about the pope? This is SOO wrong and is indeed a slipperty slope. But nothing more than political correctness run amok, and more than anything, a sign of how much we FEAR those Muslims who are extremists. Clearly the firing of this guy was nothing more than a P.R. ploy to send a MESSAGE to the radicals: "please don't align our company or organization with this particular individual. Do whatever you want to this individual but please leave our offices and the rest of our employees alone." Does the post support taxation? no What I would like to see is the responsibility for raising children to be the PARENT"S job once again. It is not the government's job to raise our children. If that includes schooling at home, then so be it. As our newly elected NY governor reminded us just today, NY State has the highest spending per pupil in the schools, yet is 34th in the rankings for quality of education. The NY State Dept of Education is way overdue for reform. Maybe a tax credit would be the kick in the pants that NY State school administrators need.

Count me among those who prefer a democracy that is economically non-optimal to a plutocracy that is economically optimal. Does the author dislike social medium? yes As others have stated, I want my taxes lowered because I don't have children and don't use the public school system (among other public services) because of it. In fact I believe I should get a tax break on my income for NOT costing the government extra by having children. Why do parents who choose to have children believe they deserve to pay LESS than I do in taxes just because they choose to breed. It is not as if they didn't know that children cost money to have and raise! Yet because they get a tax break for having them and I don't I am forced to help pay for them! If you want kids and choose to have them then YOU pay for them and don't expect to get your taxes reduced because of it!

We can blame only ourselves. The result of the Cold War was that socialists realised that no one could beat America with military force, but our education system was ripe for plucking.

Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame.

Like all other jobs today we humans are disposable workers, flight attendants included. I can handle a surly or neglectful attendant on occasion for it is a tough, demanding position but we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots. This worries me tremendously having worked for the airlines in the past. These mostly highly trained professionals are being abused and not paid decently.

But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet.

Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip.

Is the author in favor of changing tipping system? no Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control. Is the post against war drug? no It does not matter that parents who home school may pay just as much into the school system as other families. People without children pay as well and don't think this authorizes them to use the library or recreational facilities. In addition, supporting a school is not just about paying taxes. Parents who home school because they don't think public schools are good enough for their offspring weaken the very fabric of the public school system and should not seek to benefit from it. If it's not good enough for English and Math, it's not good enough for sports. (Of course, this should not apply to children who are home schooled because of special needs.) Does the author dislike school tax? no Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets.

The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012. Is the author in favor of farm subsidy? yes The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.

What a ridiculous presumptuous argument. Is the post against fact? no I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income.

And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it.

What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Is the post against public land? no Given that Europeans have not done so well integrating the Muslim immigrants they already have (witness the suspect in Belgium, where in immigrant community the employment rate is 40 percent), why should we believe this recent wave is any more assimilable? In twenty years, will Europe create even more alienated residents who are willing to slaughter their fellow citizens? Is the post against sanction? no Len Penzo writes, 'Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?' This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers.

Length of input text For some. success is achieving things that makes their parents proud of them, and results in others looking up to them. But in some cases this is meeting the expectations of others, not necessarily oneself. People need to have the independence (from their parents) to develop a sense of who they are as individuals. I would argue that a mature individual achieves success when they do things that make them feel good about themselves (for example being a social worker rather than a neurosurgeon) regardless of what others think I am reminded of lyrics from the song Garden Party sung by the late singer Rick Nelson - "you can't please everyone so you've got to please yourself". Is the author in favor of big fail? yes Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people. Does the author dislike felon? no People need sleep. Starting so early so there is enough daylight for a sports programs? That's why today so many of our graduates (?) are only good for sports programs... I am now 63, with 3 degrees from an ivy league school, and having run my own business for over 30 years and having had 100s of employees. I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep. Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally. Public schools shouldn't begin before 9:00 am. Period. Then we'll have better performing students and workers. Guaranteed. And don't tell Is the post against sport program undergraduate school? yes While we are at it, why not a tax break for people with no children since their (non-existent) kids do not use the public school system, and they still pay taxes to support it? If people choose not to use tax-payer sponsored education for their kids, do the childless taxpayers have to shoulder the burden of educating their children anyway? Would the country be better off with everyone educating their own kids? If I pay less than my fair share of taxes, am I keeping my own money or stealing it from the country? Wouldn't it be better to be worrying about the deficit, the economy and the lack of jobs? Is there any value to thinking through matters properly anymore? Does the author dislike farm industry? no One of my alma maters is Rutgers. For years, I have refused to give the school a penny of my money, believing it has long since abandoned its educational mission in favor of becoming a big-name sports school. The amounts RU has paid coaches and athletic directors is, frankly, obscene. That monstrosity of a stadium, built at a cost of $100 million, is obscene. I would be perfectly happy if RU announced tomorrow that it is eliminating sports, with the possible exception of intramural sports. I am not holding my breath, though. I like Spelman's decision to focus on the physical fitness of *every* student, not just the star athletes. Does the post support college education quality? no My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet. Is the author in favor of invention?  is 1033.

Length of input text According to Adam Mossoff: "But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context." But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new "compositions of matter"' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings? Is the author in favor of social medium? yes I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years. Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects. Does the post support constitutional monarchy? yes Those against the legalization of prostitution point to exploitation by employers like the legal brothels in Nevada, as if exploitation of workers is something unique to sex work. As commenter RC pointed out - many workplaces are abusive. There will always be employers who exploit workers no matter what kind of work. You don't respond to exploitation by making the work illegal. It's right up there with people who can't tell the difference between sex slavery and sex work. Sex slavery is horrible - not because it's sex but because it's slavery. But many people, including well-meaning people can't make the distinction because anything to do with sex just throws them into a riot of emotion and they can't calmly and dispassionately distinguish between non-exploitive freely chosen sex-work and exploitation and slavery. And anybody who tries to do look at the issue rationally is branded as naive at best and cold-hearted and colluding with sex traffickers at worst. Is the author in favor of charter school? no Do ANY programs make money after taking into account: Amortization of physical plant including all athletic venues and buildings occupied exclusively by coaches, staff and athletes. Maintenance, heating, cooling, groundskeeping, police & fire protection for all athletic facilities and the territory that surrounds them. Administrator time spent dealing with athletic scandals, criminal athletes, and spoiled coaches. Subsidized travel to post season games by administrators and board members. Also consider: The total amount of tax deductible contributions to higher ed is likely to be a relatively fixed sum within any given set of tax laws. Therefore athletic department contributions subtract from contributions to legitimate academic purposes and should be counted as a cost, not a benefit. Is the post supportive of car damage? no I agree with the commenter above -- let's have Len Penzo's salary be determined by our tips! Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it. Does the post support negative impact gambling? no I would be curious to know how many of these experts are actual parents who have or had children. My kids come home tired and then have to go through all the extra stuff that is expected --soccer, track, etc. An then they are hit with gobs of homework.

The three main reasons cited for cannabis-related substitution are 'less withdrawal' (67.7%), 'fewer side-effects' (60.4%), and 'better symptom management' suggesting that many patients may have already identified cannabis as an effective and potentially safer adjunct or alternative to their prescription drug regimen."

What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list.

Is the post against secular democracy? yes My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because "there's an American in the room". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes.

All recovery of private property because of natural disaster be nullified. My tax dollars pay for these folks to recover loses due to their choice to build in obviously unstable environments. Therefore if the public may not cross their property to access the public lands; the Federal government should not be obligated to insure and/or pay for their loses. Enough government subsidies of private luxury, private beaches. Is the post against college? no I admire vegans because they've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work, discipline and attention. I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust.

But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the post supportive of fertility procedure? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it.

Does the post support palestinian? no Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them Is the post against tax law? yes There are plenty of middlemen who would garner their profits on the increased wages. None would forego their cut -- and the retailer gets the largest share of that. Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects. If more people could employ themselves on farms, we might have a better outcome. But our incentives are not set up to promote that. Correct the incentives. We don't need more factory farms. Is the post against sport subsidy? yes Until profit-seeking sponsors parade men on stage in thongs (and what, hightops?), complete with satin sashes, plastic smiles, surgically enhanced pecs, and taped buns, and ask them stupid questions expecting stupid answers, pick Mr. Congeniality and Mr. Whatever, raise the tension till there's only two guys left, and then announce the winner and put a macho tiara (if there is such a thing) on his head as he weeps, you will be only an apologist for the most ridiculous display of inane sexism this country has ever invented.

So I say to them invest it or lose it in taxes. The utter failure of our infallible "capitalists" in this current crisis has deflated all their credibility.

The government should raise the capital gains tax until it sees this shift to foreign markets. I think you've under estimated the risk of these lower taxation countries.

I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them. Is the author in favor of american custom? yes This is a pretty offensive and inaccurate view. To compare home birthers to vaccine deniers is absurd. Hospitals have an increasing rate of cesarian births, which pose an increase risk to the mother, with 3 times the mortality rate of a vaginal birth. Transfer rates of home births are about 2-3%, meaning there is about a 97-98% chance of a vaginal birth for a baby born at home, a far safer option for the mother. Here are a couple facts to balance out these doctors inaccurate and out of date views: From the CDC: Number of vaginal deliveries: 2,642,892 Number of Cesarean deliveries: 1,284,339 Percent of all deliveries by Cesarean: 32.7% From Wikipedia: In those who are low risk the risk of death for Caesarian sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world.

Is the author in favor of admission standard college? yes There is absolutly nothing wrong with a vegan diet in any of the stages of life, there are many cases of life long vegans from all over the world who are very healthy so i will rule out genetics and ancestry roots to what we can tolerate or not. the problem with why some people think it is inadequate is because they do not know what vegans can or cannot eat, and then there is a lot of misinformation from people that want to protect their own interest of meat eating telling others that it is dangerous! if you plan well your diet and know what you are eating then it is as simple as pie and anybody can benefit from a strict vegetrian diet. it is obvious that if all you eat is lettuce it can be very dangerous for you and most probably fatal, the same can be said if all you eat is red meat with red meat! however if you eat a wide variety of plant based foods your body can aquire all of the essential nutrients that it needs to thrive. Does the author dislike apps? no The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.

I understand he is now busy counting his loot at Warburg, but perhaps between meals at Nobu he could give us a few words. Is the author in favor of substitute teacher? no I agree that parents (and the kids, once they're old enough--say, 16) should have the right to opt in or out of SOME vaccinations--namely, ones for diseases that are hard to spread. Hepatitis B? HPV? Be my guest--that choice only affects your family, because those are not diseases your kid can spread at school, on the bus, etc. But no one without a medical exemption should be able to opt out of vaccinations against HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, very dangerous diseases like German measles, pertussis/whooping cough, mumps (which can leave little boys permanently infertile), etc. Measles can live on surfaces like classroom desks and the metal handles people hold in buses for several hours. Nobody has the right to expose complete strangers to devastating diseases that are so easy to prevent. Does the author dislike deportation? no I would agree that fares dropped between the big hubs, but for us who live in the hinterlands and have to drive 2 hours to an airport which is served by a grand total of 2 airlines, not so much. Airfares on the two airlines are always within 10 dollars of each other. The airfare for a 45 minute flight to the hub is about the same as any flight from that hub to any other destination so the end result is flying costs twice as much than if you flew from a hub. The end result is the hub and spoke system results in lower fares where there is competition and a virtual oligopoly at the end of each spoke. Granted, it is not a monopoly which would cause scrutiny, but the airlines collusion acts like one. Add to that, most of the flying public knows what happens with a weather related problem at a hub. The ripple effects throughout the system impact much more than just one hub. Sorry, deregulation resulted in much higher fares and much worse service when weather intervenes.

However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Does the post support veganism? yes Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly. Is the post supportive of slave trade? no These law schools will say and do almost anything to avoid having to reduce the number of law students, which is really the only solution to this whole mess. As an attorney who's taken and passed some of the hardest bar exams in the nation, I will tell you that bar exams are not that hard. If you can't pass them, then you don't deserve to practice. Law schools need to quit whining about the bar and take a long look in the mirror. Either find better students, take fewer of them, or tank your ranking. Either way, blaming the system is just excuse-making. Does the post support check? no I agree. The royal family needs to be taxed and pay their own bills like everyone else. Their decadent luxurious lifestyles are ludicous and outdated especially when the UK is facing severe austerity measures. William and Kate should pay for their own wedding. They are not indigent. The royals could make a fortune selling exclusive wedding photos to the tabloids. Personally, I cannot understand why couples live together before they get married when the research shows that they are more likely to become divorced than those couples who don't. I am old fashioned and think that marriage is a sacrament. I think that William and Kate are setting a bad example like all the other celebrities and other heterosexual people that are living together without being married. Is the author in favor of equal opportunity? yes Having lived in countries where tipping is not expected most of my adult life, my personal view is that the restaurant owners need to pay their staff a living wage (ok, so prices go up) and get the waiters off the backs of the customers. Better for us, and, yes, better for the waiters as well! Does the post support high fructose corn syrup? no If we just had millions upon billions living in unindustrialized countries or places in which people had no discretionary income to participate in a consumer society, Erhlich would have remained wrong. But societies around the globe have changed, and everyone desires a higher standard of living. Now Erhlich is right. Okay, let's make an effort to reduce consumption. But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income? I would suggest that there is more to the challenge than "to fix capitalism by encouraging innovation in the technologies that can deliver a liveable world. " There will have to be a philosophy with which to address nature and the universe, for both the powers-that-be and hoi polloi. Is the author in favor of changing tipping system?  is 1054.

Length of input text The parenting Amy Chua is selling as Chinese is actually very common everywhere. I've seen many parents pushing their kids hard to take useless piano and violin lessons for reasons more connected with snobbery that the talent of the kid and I've seen people that parents pushed hard to become doctors or lawyers who at some point when they discovered that they are free adults that can make their own choices turned their backs at those careers and often at their parents. This is not Eastern philosophy, just an over controlling parent that is using her power over her kids to achieve goals for herself. Most shocking is her audacity to present her attitude as a way to follow. Is the author in favor of hospital birth? no In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot, or to remove the plastic wrap of something before eating. I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that. Does the author dislike election? no Obama is absolutely right. But it's not just death in war - homicide is way down. People think that the murder rate is high because the news tells us about horrible murders. It is a fact that the homicide rate is lower than it has ever been: you were far more likely to die by murder in every other era. We have the data for Western Europe going back about 1000 years, and the murder rate is lower than its ever been. Even hunter gatherers, whom we like to glorify as living peaceful, natural lives, had higher murder rates than we do. Is the author in favor of company? yes My daughter would LOVE to be able to opt in and out of classes at the Virginia public high school she attends. Personally, I would LOVE to be able to pull her out of certain classes and get her tutored in them or some such. But that's now how it works. If her high school is not good enough for these kids to attend, then they have no business being there playing sports. It is not a cafeteria, you don't get to pick and choose what you do and do take off the tray. Why don't we just take team sports out of the schools and make them a separate institution? Certainly a lot of the folks who are gung ho on their local high school football and basketball programs don't give much of a damn about the academics of those students anyway so long as they can have a winning team. Let's set up something elsewhere and let the rest of our kids concentrate on getting an education that will enable them to do something besides playing sports! Is the author in favor of mine? no When I observe that admission standards and courses in "college" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and "college" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more "remedial cases" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just "we want workers ready to start tomorrow" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces. Is the post supportive of retired rn? no Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control. Is the post against war drug?  is 1081. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text There is absolutly nothing wrong with a vegan diet in any of the stages of life, there are many cases of life long vegans from all over the world who are very healthy so i will rule out genetics and ancestry roots to what we can tolerate or not. the problem with why some people think it is inadequate is because they do not know what vegans can or cannot eat, and then there is a lot of misinformation from people that want to protect their own interest of meat eating telling others that it is dangerous! if you plan well your diet and know what you are eating then it is as simple as pie and anybody can benefit from a strict vegetrian diet. it is obvious that if all you eat is lettuce it can be very dangerous for you and most probably fatal, the same can be said if all you eat is red meat with red meat! however if you eat a wide variety of plant based foods your body can aquire all of the essential nutrients that it needs to thrive. Does the author dislike apps? no Maternal maturity is just as important as fertility when deciding when to have children. Very few women younger than age 25 have the maturity and necessary life experiences to become a mother at such a young age. At least in my opinion, the best time to become a Mom is somewhere between 25 and 35. The maturity is there, fertility is generally decent and chronic health problems have not yet set in. Is the post supportive of police department? yes I agree with Mr. DeLorenzo, range anxiety is a huge issue with EV's. The current technology does not provide an affordable energy storage system. I am aware that Tesla has an EV capable of 300 miles per charge but the current model starts at $101,500, however they have another model scheduled to debut in 2012 for $49,000 (including a $7,500 tax credit). Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas. I just cant see them ever being more than a niche market, until an affordable car comes around with a range similar to comparable ICE vehicles. With an infrastructure that will be able to support them, including charging stations and an improved electrical grid Does the author dislike minimum wage? yes I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post against secular democracy? yes Until profit-seeking sponsors parade men on stage in thongs (and what, hightops?), complete with satin sashes, plastic smiles, surgically enhanced pecs, and taped buns, and ask them stupid questions expecting stupid answers, pick Mr. Congeniality and Mr. Whatever, raise the tension till there's only two guys left, and then announce the winner and put a macho tiara (if there is such a thing) on his head as he weeps, you will be only an apologist for the most ridiculous display of inane sexism this country has ever invented. Is the author in favor of wealth? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision. Is the post supportive of antidepressant? no Most (American)parents do not realize that sucess and money flows from a good education. The most sucessful ethnic groups do not strive for wealth it flows from having well educated children. And the thing that goes hand in glove with that thinking is that it is ultimately the parents job to see that their child is learning and getting a good education and not leave it up to schools. The teachers and administration will still be recieveing their collective paychecks long after your kids have moved on. Is the author in favor of pot? yes In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness? Is the post supportive of justice ginsberg expressing opinion? yes First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life. Everyone is afraid or too embarrassed to say the truth. Is the post against marriage? no On our farm I frequently employ inmates from the county jail. A couple of thoughts here, ... according to my prospective jailed employees, in every case the judge has gotten it wrong and they are not guilty. They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks. I really don't know what we can do about this dead weight in society. Are Austrailia and New Zealand still accepting prisoners? Is the post supportive of palestinian state? no Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization. Does the author dislike arm sale taiwan?  is 1046.

Nowadays, we have this magical thing called the internet. There are no excuses for not knowing what's healthy and what isn't. You're either too lazy to figure it out for yourself (and so you let the food companies tell you what to eat -- nice conflict of interest right there), or you simply don't care. I also like how you mention ridiculous "documented" results yet fail to provide said documents. A "50% reduction in the incidence of children becoming overweight." You can deduce that just by changing drinks in a vending machine? Please tell what analysis was performed to come to that fitting conclusion -- as a statistician, I'd love to know.

Every rich out of towner shows up, buys property that has allowed public access of one kind or another for centuries, and then does their damnedest to change the rules. Hey pal, you're a smart guy, you knew what you were buying! On the other hand, I think members of the public should respect the adjacent property owners by keeping litter, noise and nuisance to a minimum. The only thing that I know that can close a beach to access here is piping plovers hatching. Does the post support fifa? yes OK.

Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of tfa? yes In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality. Is the post against republican party? yes My respect for doctors plummets still further with this ignorant, scientific clap trap.

There is further the danger of causing the disease to be far more severe as the natural immunity of the population disappears ( check what measles did in the South Pacific) And then there is the compromised immune systems due to the injected toxins under the guise of adjuvants You are told that vaccines don't cause SIDS and autism etc etd Well listed as side effects on the vaccine inserts! America has very poor child health and is the most vaccinated country on earth Down around 197 Now go and do some independent research and try to sort out your country Does the post support advocating home birth? no The issue is not whether refugees are good people or not -- rather the concern should be that those fleeing war in Syria should not all be going to Europe. A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants. Nations can and should have workable policies on immigration, capable of being followed and enforced. THis is an issue quite separate from that of terrorism, and one that has been a major political issue in the US for decades already. Is the post against miss america organization?  is 1110.

The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern.

I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it.

McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States?

Is the post supportive of delayed living? no "But I certainly would fire any of my employees who would consider flag-burning as an act of defiance. It's not. It's childish and immature behavior, and those who would do such a thing would be unworthy of public employment." Actually, I once told my wife that if an amendment were actually passed banning flag-burning, I would burn one the next day on the steps of the Supreme Court. It's not necessarily an act of childish defiance; it can be an all-in statement of what is important about this country. By the way, flag-burning is required by law. Last time I looked, it was the only proper way to dispose of a flag too worn to be flown any more. Does the post support first amendment? yes I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody. Is the author in favor of nfl? no How large is the (significant) difference between outcomes for a baby born at home and one born in the hospital? And, is it due to the inclusion in this data of incompetent midwives? I have known several women who gave birth at home, and wished to do so myself, but couldn't because of complications. My experience of birthing in a hospital with a male resident was quite unpleasant. He touched me and examined me without asking my permission. He said my membranes had not broken and I was urinating. Every woman who has experienced membranes breaking knows the difference. A woman/midwife wouldn't have done/said these things this. Childbirth is difficult enough without unempathic male doctors. Is the post against populism? yes Reviewing recent press articles discussing corruption, bribes, and other nefarious activities to rig the political system, I am struck by how inexpensive our corrupt politicians actually are. Apparently several political leaders were willing to sell their votes and offer their influence for a bribe in the amount of $7,500, other bribes were in the range of $10,000 - $20,000. Don't these fellows have any self-respect? Couldn't they at least hold out for a six figure sum? Yes, corruption in politics is distasteful, and of course, illegal. But who will have any confidence in corrupt politicians who sell themselves so cheaply? Please, people, shouldn't we value our politicians more highly, even the corrupt ones? Is the post against electric rate? no OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the author in favor of school data?  is 1182.

Length of input text Maureen Dowd had a bad trip and so we all supposed to return to the dark ages of marijuana use. I drank a pitcher of Cabo Wabo marguarettas a couple of weeks ago and thought I was going to die the next day. Are we going to prohibit tequila because of my bad trip? I wish! Dang that stuff is good. Too good for amateurs like me. I don't know if bottlers still put the alcohol content on hard liquor, but they used to. It was a handy guide for beginning drinkers.....like college students. But then some people used it as a guide to get as drunk as possible, as fast as possible. You cannot legislate the stupidity out of people and you cannot protect them from every thing. But creating a THC meter and putting it on the package would be very considerate. It probably wouldn't help stupid people like the above mentioned columnist, who just crammed the stuff in her mouth without even doing any research, but it would show a sense of responsibility on the part of the marijuana industry. Does the post support miss america? no The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew up on them and would increase their profits moderately if they were caught and had to pay modest fines. No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete. Nationalizing banks would make it clearer than ever that the banks were too big to fail (and could engage in even more risky behavior on more profitable terms than their competitors who lacked the too big to fail guarantee). Is the post supportive of home school education? no Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly. Is the post supportive of islam? no I was born in London my parents came to America at the age of 21 I was naturalized I chose to keep my British passport because it is my right. My parents are Irish born My father waited the required 7 yrs to become naturalized my mother never did. of course she has a SS# I can also claim Irish citizenship as well which I plan to do also hopefully in the near future Is the post supportive of tax? yes What the NJ Transit employee failed to understand is that there is a distinction between free speech rights (burning a Koran, a flag or what have you) and the fact that employment in America is, by and large, at-will -- you can get fired if your boss doesn't like the color of your socks. If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him.

Is the post supportive of yes iran threat? yes In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran.

Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women. We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents. Just ask Honey Boo Boo.

Is the post against american political system? yes Back in the day when I had my own office I could display artwork, plants, photos, and make my workspace an oasis where I enjoyed spending time. And I could welcome others in to share that space with me. The open plan destroyed individuality. It is DE-HUMANIZING. I now have no place to keep my possessions. Collaboration is DISCOURAGED because people can't sit comfortably together and talk for any length of time. In an open space, most people keep headphones on to shut out distractions. I find that when there are no walls, people build their own, just to keep sane. Does the author dislike vegetarianism? no First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either. Is the author in favor of intellectual? no Based on the fact that many people without children, children out of school, or renters for that matter, still end up paying property taxes to fund schools in their areas, the tax breaks seem unfair. The fact is that that EVERYONE has a vested interest in the education of the kids in their communities,therefore everyone should pay. Let anyone school their kids however they want, but don't jeopardize the education of the public as a whole, to grant favoritism to a few who school their children in one certain way. Does the author dislike beachfront home? yes The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, "Don't you love your kids?" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising. It IS a simple concept.

When dropped to inpatient sub acute care a gerontologist treating me prescribed Percocet for pain. I refused any medication other than prescribed by my neurosurgeon. In my situation a phone consultation with my neurosurgeon would have been best practice. Percocet could have destroyed any chance I had to regain neurological and cognitive function.

This young man is completely American, totally fluent in English, no accent, and loves the U.S. So, should he be able to become a U.S. citizen? He's waiting to find out how. My vote: Of course!! Is the post supportive of regulation airline fee? yes My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children. Is the post supportive of israeli national boundary? yes Of course the YPG have been coordinating with the Russians, so has the United States! Moderate rebels? Seriously? Just because the Rebels opposing the Syrian Democratic Forces are backed by Turkey does that make them moderate? The Kurdish led coalition with Arabs and Syriac-Assyrians want to create a secular democracy within the borders of an autonomous region in a land otherwise ruled by terror. Is that such a bad thing? The whole point of war is to seize territory from those that are trying to kill you. Always has been all ways will.

Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet. I, for one, can't bear the thought of a female pig in a gestation crate for all her adult life. Does the author dislike verify? no Dear Nina, with all due respect, one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years, without the Western diet posited by you! It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world! Does the author dislike workplace? no So much of the debate focuses on when to give birth. Very little discussion addresses what happens next. I had my two children in my mid-thirties; quite the norm for professional women. Now I am in my fifties, dealing with teenagers who need me almost as much as an infant does-late nights, multiple crises, job interruptions, feeding, talking to, sturm und drang; as well as aging parents who also delayed childbirth till later in life. My husband's and my parents are older than most, more fragile, grappling with health issues, dementia, financial, housing, and end-of-life difficulties. They need every bit as much attention as our teenagers do. As do our careers, at peak. So which of these competing interests gets short- changed? There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish fervently I'd had my kids in my twenties. They'd be grown by now, and I could take at least one thing off my plate. I am tired. I'd love to be able to kick back and enjoy grand kids and nothing else. Is the post supportive of difference religion? yes great article - as a child of a 'western-parenting style' family who is married to an asian man who grew up with the same chinese-style parenting addressed in her article - I believe that this kind of parenting WILL eventually create independent, thoughtful adults - who have the confidence and skills to succeed in this competitive world. I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it. Is the post supportive of prescription opioids? yes I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program. Does the post support heroin? no Mining is also an intolerable job, but people do it because they are paid much more than they could make at any other available job, I believe about $60K/year which is good money in the poor parts of the country. LOTS of jobs are difficult and/or dangerous but they pay enough to attract people, at least people who don't readily have better options. This is STRICTLY a matter of wages. For $60K/year, I betcha lots of people would learn to pick vegetables and fruit. Does the author dislike bank regulation?  is 1051. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

Length of input text Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control. Is the post against war drug? no I think it is ironic that Trump, who believes he can say anything regardless of how offensive it is, is denouncing Justice Ginsburg for stating her opinion. Also, those who believe that 1st Amendment rights allow them to speak their mind about anything even if it is false, are quick to silence others for any reason as long as it is in disagreement with their views. I was very glad to hear Justice Ginsburg speak her mind. We certainly heard the late Justice Scalia's views. Does the author dislike technological innovation? yes How to start re regulating? What's the difference between this now, where the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks, despite public opinion, and the banking S&L crisis when hundreds were prosecuted and jailed? Clinton started the deregulation of banks in the 90s. Lobbying and campaign donations have hugely increased, esp since the 2010 court decision. How can the govt untangle itself from the corporate hold on its powers? It's as if the govt is really regulated by the banks and corporations, rather than the govt regulating the banks. And all in the name of 'free speech' and free private enterprise. And in this bad economy with huge unemployment, the banks threaten more joblessness and recession if they are not left to do as they please. Where's the rebuttal in our main media? The majority of the public is anti big bank and want to break them up. The democracy isn't working. Is the author in favor of admission standard college? yes This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do. Is the post supportive of citizenship? yes Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money. Does the post support adoption? yes If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir. Is the author in favor of radical islamist?  is 1220.

People without children pay as well and don't think this authorizes them to use the library or recreational facilities. In addition, supporting a school is not just about paying taxes. Parents who home school because they don't think public schools are good enough for their offspring weaken the very fabric of the public school system and should not seek to benefit from it. If it's not good enough for English and Math, it's not good enough for sports. (Of course, this should not apply to children who are home schooled because of special needs.) Is the post against young people? no I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate. However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality. Is the author in favor of basketball rule? no "Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves. Is the post supportive of tax break homeschooling parent? yes Wow, really!? I'd be for if my wife and I can get a tax break from school taxes altogether. Since we don't and won't have children the tax break would do wonders for our economic recovery. The whole idea is bogus. The whole idea of home schooling seems egotistically self-indulgent in the first place. If the homeschooling parents aren't happy with the current state of the schools why not become teachers themselves? They obvously think they're more qualified than the professionals presently doing the job. Just because you think you can do a better job than someone else doesn't mean you ACTUALLY can do it better. Does the post support assad? yes Undoubtedly, ISIS is a well-organized terrorist organization that aspires to damage the United States in any way possible. The brutal murder of James Foley led some (like Ryan Crocker) to call for increased military strikes in Syria. However, we should not carry out such attacks without considering their impact on Assad's regime. Even an uncoordinated airstrike is likely to damped international pressure against him. It legitimizes his struggle against the rebels and diverts conversations away from his crimes against humanity. We must remember that Assad is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 of his own civilians - sometimes through the use of weapons of mass destruction. As the Syrian leader he had a special obligation to protect the very people he murdered. No one reasonably expects ISIS to carry out attacks on this scale. Military activity in Syria should only occur in the context of a struggle against an authoritarian dictator. Does the post support pharmaceutical company?  is 1045.

Does the post support mandatory foreign language course? yes "[T]here were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants." That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a "net employment gain"? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses. But that's obviously not how the economy works. Does the post support technical/vocational? no A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs. Just not a lot. Does the author dislike intellectual property? no America absolutely cannot and has loost all credibility as an honest broker a long time ago - except with corrupt Arab despots and dictaters such as was the case with Mubarak and now abdullawhom of saudi arabia whom it nurtures and protects. Does the author dislike reservation? yes i don't know about the situation in vermont, but in california where i did field work for three years in the early 60s during my teens, out of thirty labor workers, the ones hoeing and moving sprinklers, there were only two of us were american citizens. in fact, it was difficult for me to get hired because i was too white for farm work, the black foreman, Art Davis said, and I wouldn't last. What he said was usually true. When we needed extra help to pull up grape vineyards 10 car loads of guys [two to five guys per car] from the Ontario unemployment office came out at 6:00 a.m..

Length of input text I challenge a New Hampshire liberal who has a child with a well-developed sense of humor to object to all sorts of things in his or her school's curriculum. What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read "Uncle Tom's Cabin," they must refer to it as "Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin," because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list. I'm sure you can think of many more. Anyone who wants to free-lance education on my dime deserves to end up spluttering in red-faced rage. And that's all I have to say about that. Is the post supportive of relationship? yes I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space. Is the author in favor of us policy? yes Now would be a good time to begin instituting a serious conservation program to obviate the need for whatever oil might be found off shore in the Atlantic. What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis? Is the author in favor of sanction? yes I fear that any attack by the US will be in violation of the laws will leads like the Libyan intervention to move on to regime change. There is never anything like limited interventions -- this is why I see this leading to a full scale ware in which we are on the side of Al Quaeda and will ensure the massacre of christians and alawites at the hands of Al Quaeda. Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself. We have people in authority like Susan Rice and Samantha Powers that will use any excuse no matter how flimsy to indulge in regime change. They don't care that the US is broke and we have lots of problems at home. They have their eyes fixed on getting rid of Assad and they don't care about the US at all. Is the author in favor of flood? no Ms Nina Planck ...stated Nature created humans as omnivores....which seem to be she has a direct connection to god but eventually its never true .. then let me tell why we called Human being the most intelligent creature on earth ??? because we can judge which is good for us with the sense of humor if this is not hold rue then we would rather called our self animals..Eating flesh is a not kind of human behavior because we lost our humanity and develop a attitude like animal.Animal do sex so do we however they do not know with whom they slept with on contrary we know.So vegan-ism diet which pure and lucid and it has many more advantage over non-veg-ism as so many has suggested. I am not a spiritual guru who talks about spirituality.But yes we can grow up our kid even with the veg intake that will lead his/her to be better and healthy person. Does the post support proper food preparation? yes A lower tax rate on unearned income than on income earned from work is an insult to all working Americans. No matter how much blah-blah people from the Cato Institute and other dens of traitors spew, lower taxes or -- Zounds! -- NO taxes on coupon-clipping is a throwback to the days of the nobility expecting us peasant to step into the gutter and touch our caps when their Lordships passed by.

Length of input text I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement. On a pain scale from 1-10, I am probably at 12 or 13 all day long. I am 5'3" and weigh 250 pounds. I can walk about 100 feet without my cane and can stand for about 5 minutes. I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being. There are many more out there like me and we should not be judged by appearances. Is the post supportive of bibi netanyahu? no I find the belief that children raised the Asian way will turn out to be dull and uncreative a little hard to believe. This is just one huge ethnocentric stereotype we are producing to counter the Chinese lady's ethnocentrism. In reality, the competence that Asians drill into their children has translated into remarkable commercial and technical success, and they have longstanding traditions in the arts that are also not much less creative than the stuff coming out of the US. So let's drone on about our great creativity while the Asians run circles around us. Does the post support banking fee? yes True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila! Does the post support living wage? yes Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians. Is the post against minimum wage? no Amen. It almost seems like the menu is part of a bait and switch operation. That $32 osso bucco is not $32 as printed on the menu, it's $38. Dessert is not $8, it's $9.60. You can do the arithmetic on a bottle of wine. Your $120 check actually runs you $144. God forbid you take the whole family out. Is the post supportive of educator? no The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise. Is the post against school budget?  is 1032.

/home/mila/c/cesare.spinoso/In-context-Tuning/src/data_loader.py:171: UserWarning: MODEL LENGTH EXCEEDED. Length of input text If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys. Does the author dislike small farmer? yes First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life. Everyone is afraid or too embarrassed to say the truth. Is the post supportive of childbirth? yes As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others. Is the post supportive of living wage? no "Syria's opposition strongly rejects ethnic discrimination" The same Saudi-backed opposition who joined hands with Turkish AKP officials to refuse the Syrian Kurds a chair at their own civil war peace talks table? What a clownish and unsubstantiated claim... Then we all know that half the "Syrian opposition" fighters are made of al-Nusra front aka Al Qaeda in Syria, "people" who have a blatant sectarian and "ethnic discrimination" agenda against every non Sunni people but also against the Sunni Syrian Kurds: "Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwa calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq's Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Kurdistan#Syrian_Civil_War) "The Independent reported that Saudi Arabia and Turkey "are focusing their backing for the Syrian rebels on the combined Jaish al-Fatah, or the Army of Conquest, a command structure for jihadist groups in Syria that includes Jabhat al-Nusra." (wikipedia, Al-Nusra_Front#External_support) Is the post against public land? no i travel in many places in the world where tipping is really just that..Not in the US where it should be called 'wages'. And the restaurants are packed. (see Paris etc). When you get the bill you don't have to factor in TAXES, TIPPING etc. Just because something has been done for years doesn't make it a good thing. Does the author dislike agricultural land owner? no Flash backwards to 1972, Colorado, where the newly enfranchised 18 year olds put into office a whole rash of liberal democrats. I was one of those young voters. I have no doubt that young people today can similarly influence elections. And I sincerely hope they will. Does the author dislike fertility?  is 1025.

Does the author dislike cat? no 1. This 'Food Babe' (neat commercial!) seems to think that her personal campaigns forced some mega food companies to change their labels. Consumer protest works, but not when it is a solo effort. A bit much self-promotion here. 2. This debate is about one word, "natural." Language is too complex for the debate to be about one word. The issue is can claiming in the name that something is not present. It defies logic to state in a product name that lemon is in the product when in fact there is no lemon at all. That is simply misleading (bold face lying). "Lemon" in common nomenclature is something that comes from the lemon plant, not it's laboratory produced analog. Isn't truth in advertising the issue? 3. My food slogan is "I'm very careful about what I put in my mouth." So that unfortunately means every label must be scrutinized. Does the author dislike religion prosecution? no At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason! Is the author in favor of foreign university? yes My work, as a network engineer, takes me to foreign countries for months at a time. Europe, South America, South Asia. Wherever I go the business meetings are always conducted in English, because foreign universities require it for professional degrees however.... At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al. The US is losing its technical lead over the rest of the world, and foreign professionals increasingly resent having to speak English because "there's an American in the room". Since I create the project requirements and network architecture for foreign companies, not understanding their language can lead to expensive mistakes. Does the author dislike sex school? no Wow, really!? I'd be for if my wife and I can get a tax break from school taxes altogether. Since we don't and won't have children the tax break would do wonders for our economic recovery. The whole idea is bogus. The whole idea of home schooling seems egotistically self-indulgent in the first place. If the homeschooling parents aren't happy with the current state of the schools why not become teachers themselves? They obvously think they're more qualified than the professionals presently doing the job. Just because you think you can do a better job than someone else doesn't mean you ACTUALLY can do it better. Does the post support assad? yes Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use. Overall, this is another person who tries to spin around what is actually happening. Is the author in favor of candidate 's spouse?  is 1101. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

First, separate again Investment bank and place under the strict jurisdiction and supervision. Does the author dislike kurd? no I wasn't aware that Justice Ginsburg automatically surrendered her basic Constitutional rights when she joined the Supreme Court, just as I wasn't aware that President Obama automatically surrendered some of his prerogatives during the final year of his second term simply because it is the final year. I keep looking in the Constitution for the relevant Article or Amendment that declares it so, but fail to find it. Perhaps my research techniques are deficient in some way. Perhaps Sen. McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States? Are those better questions for Professor Gillers to ponder than whether Justice Ginsburg spoke out of turn, or whether her desire not to play mute swan in a golf course pond offends tender Republican sensitivities. Is the post supportive of delayed living? no Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Does the author dislike international trade? no "Moreover, once recognition is granted, the international community will heave a sigh of relief and move on, leaving it to the Palestinians to get their act together against a backdrop of Israeli noncompliance and nonacceptance of this move." If the international community (Who is that anyway? The UN? Grass-roots activists?) haven't moved on by now, they never will. The stupidity and hatred that allows them to believe Israel is the cause of all things Middle East is as tenacious as mold, and twice as pungent. Is the post against m small? yes Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly. Does the author dislike school finland? yes Drones are a weapon of the weak willed. Relying on them gives those unfamiliar with successful counter-insurgency tactics and strategies a sense of security when in fact the opposite is happening. If you do not 'drain the swamp' or wipe out the entire support systems that enable the insurgent/terrorist to survive, they multiply like vermin. Therefore we see the spread of the scourge throughout Africa and the Middle East. Also, the mood of these countries, especially Egypt, is increasingly anti-American. Had we wiped out the terrorists with our ground troops in and around Afghanistan (including the uncontrolled areas in Pakistan), with the correct number of troops needed, we would not be facing this problem today of increasing terrorism in Afghanistan and our troops under attack from the very Afghan military and police. Our policy is corrupt, ineffective and weak -- and it is the policy of the present Administration -- dragging our nation ever more into an abyss.

In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play.

The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate. Is the post against public higher education? yes Most places I personally have occasion to visit, I note Lations are doing most of the manual labor task. Our family recently built a large home in Austin. As we watched construction all craftsmen including those who constructed a large complicated swimming pool area where all Latino. Both the home in Austin and another in Palm beach Gardens Florida I note, all the garbage collection , yard maintainece, pool service, house cleaning, is all folks of Latino origin. I also understand while I haven't ever seen it, most of our frutis and vegtables are harvested by Lation's, as are our meat and poultry processing plants. What does this tell us? It tells me blacks and white people either wont work for these wages, or won't do that type work. Is the author in favor of college athletics? yes My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children of the active PTA parents were receiving all the awards, and maybe some people would find that wrong, replied, "It just proves that parental involvement equals student achievement." When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, "We weren't offered any other options." When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal. Does the author dislike mother teresa? yes Not all who study law want to practice law. They may want to get into business fields where the law degree and some knowledge is helpful. Many students not adept at test taking make wonderful lawyers, not for research perhaps but as litigators. Law Exams in California go for three days and they are very tough but the best top schools have high percentages passing as they take Bar Review courses for a month or so before the actual three day grind. Only graduates from the top law schools with the best grades get the jobs with the giant law firms if that is what you crave you better have passed the bar the first time out. Passing the bar takes hard study and determination. The Law is not a profession for sissies.

Length of input text Len Penzo writes, 'Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?' This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers. Does the post support real food? no The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps. Is the author in favor of vegetarianism? no Our school district is terrrible, and the results even worse. Last year a child was T-Bagged and beaten because he was white by a group of black football players. No one was punished...b/c they were afraid of the moron parents. We send all 3 kids to private school at a considerable expense to ourselves yet the money we pay in taxes goes to the school we had to pull our kids from. Is that fair? Is the author in favor of vegan sport? yes This article screams entitlement. After a year, you're an expert? Having been in the trenches of education reform for 25 years before becoming a classroom teacher a few years ago, I can tell you that your youthful arrogance is extremely naive. Whatever talk Washington is talking today will be different than the talk Washington will be talking in a few years. In the meantime, y'all keep flitting in and out of these children's worlds and patting yourselves on the back for making such a difference. I used to admire Teach for America back in the day when it was beginning. It is now populated by such an entitled group of self-serving neophytes who believe only they have THE true answer to the problems of public education that I have lost all respect. Oh, and dear - could you a) list each of the "much easier ways to burnish a resume," and b) look the students and their families in the face when you speak of ",,,hard labor in some of the crummiest classrooms in America?" I'm sure they'd appreciate the reference. Is the post against workplace? no These law schools will say and do almost anything to avoid having to reduce the number of law students, which is really the only solution to this whole mess. As an attorney who's taken and passed some of the hardest bar exams in the nation, I will tell you that bar exams are not that hard. If you can't pass them, then you don't deserve to practice. Law schools need to quit whining about the bar and take a long look in the mirror. Either find better students, take fewer of them, or tank your ranking. Either way, blaming the system is just excuse-making. Does the post support check? no Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012. Is the post supportive of legislation?  is 1031. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.

If the international community (Who is that anyway? The UN? Grass-roots activists?) haven't moved on by now, they never will. The stupidity and hatred that allows them to believe Israel is the cause of all things Middle East is as tenacious as mold, and twice as pungent. Is the post against m small? yes Excellent idea. However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this issue all year long, and for this 'room for debate' issue in particular. While the Times deemed it appropriate to ask a Muslim living in the UK to write on the issue (of course, pro migration) for the sake of journalistic integrity the Room for debate should have also hosted the point of view of a native European citizen from any country who opposes it. It has come to the point that the people with the most to loose and with all the rights, are pushed aside, their rights and opinions discarded. Is the post against investment public school? no I am with Sandra from WA all the way. I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full. Is the post supportive of israel? no True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila! Does the post support living wage? yes I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program. Does the author dislike unhealthy diet? yes Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own.

Length of input text One need not read any of these articles to know the answer to the question, "should those with beach front homes have to open their land to the public?" because the answer is an emphatic no. Odds are that anyone who owns beach front property so alluring that total strangers would want to indulge in it is probably pretty well off, and in 21st century America nothing is more precious than safeguarding the rights and interests of those who are well off. The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens. Does the author dislike public university? yes It's fine for students to discuss these different political dynamics, the world has all sorts of opinions and to constrain political thought is narrow. Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties. As far as voting, surely the Massachusetts Democrat Primary is a great example of how young people, students influenced the primary. The Boston area, Amherst, MA and other heavily populated college towns turned out strongly for Bernie Sanders. That was an extremely close race against a very established, heavily favored Hillary Clinton. Is the author in favor of slavery reparation? yes As the 61 year old parent of two late 20 year olds I think all the helicopter parents here who think they can monitor their kids to the nth degree and not destroy the relationship are out of their minds. In particular "I have the gold I make the rules" is the relationship of master and servant. If you want your kids to quit school and be waitresses or bartenders to get you off their back keep repeating "i own you until you pay your own bills". If you want a lawyer, a Doctor an MBA or a Phd in the family you have to learn to respect their autonomy while still providing support. Respect for autonomy starts early and grows as the child grows. The years between 13 and 18 are critical. The child has to learn self control and you have to learn to let go and respect your childs autonomy. Otherwise there is an explosion when they hit 18 Is the author in favor of business? yes Wealth did not work for me for financial aid. My dad owned a 15 unit apartment building and that was considered to be worth $200,000 on my FAFSA. The run-down building had a leaky roof and lost money, and was torn down a few years later at a total loss. My parents total income was $11,000 at the time, and they were expected to contribute $4,500 per year (they said no). Hence, I went to a state school. I think income is better! Is the post supportive of corruption? yes Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from doctors who spend 5 minutes with them before moving on to the next patient. I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do? Does the author dislike wealthy college? no Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money.

Length of input text My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful. Is the author in favor of tax break? no I do not understand why he was fired. He just burned a book and expressed his frustration with a belief that he finds abhorrant. What is immoral about that? It is important that people have freedom to believe as they wish as long as they do not hurt others. But it is also our right be able to criticize and express frustation with a belief that we may feel is an anathema to our values. Does the post support foreign language? yes We cannot depend on private industry to instantly know the best way to intervene in a disaster. There are problems that normal businesses simply don't prepare for - being cut off from supplies, having to work with only the employees that are able to show up, keeping track of things with no computers. This is what FEMA is FOR. They plan for this. They rehearse. They have experience with prior situations, and learn from each one what worked and what didn't. Why should communities re-invent the wheel? FEMA knows how to tap the local resources and guide them in how best to help. There HAS to be a centralized command structure so you don't end up with 25 truckloads of drinking water and no food. Do they always get everything right? Of course not. But I'll take my chances with an experienced crew over even the best intentions of someone trying to figure things out as they go. Is the post against legalization drug? yes I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years. Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects. Does the post support constitutional monarchy? yes I agree. The royal family needs to be taxed and pay their own bills like everyone else. Their decadent luxurious lifestyles are ludicous and outdated especially when the UK is facing severe austerity measures. William and Kate should pay for their own wedding. They are not indigent. The royals could make a fortune selling exclusive wedding photos to the tabloids. Personally, I cannot understand why couples live together before they get married when the research shows that they are more likely to become divorced than those couples who don't. I am old fashioned and think that marriage is a sacrament. I think that William and Kate are setting a bad example like all the other celebrities and other heterosexual people that are living together without being married. Is the post supportive of muslim terrorist? no This article is mainly about: (a) The health risks that the entire VEGAN population (both adults and children) face. (b) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGAN diet. (c) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGETARIAN diet. (d) The health risks that the entire VEGETARIAN population (both adults and children) face. The correct answer is (b). Some of these comments make wonder about the commenter's reading comprehension skills. Nina isn't saying that it's unhealthy to raise kids on a VEGETARIAN diet (i.e. one that includes eggs and dairy). Neither is she saying that adults should not be vegan due to health risks. She is saying that it's risky for BABIES AND CHILDREN to be fed a vegan diet. Why are so many people responding to this article with long-winded replies about how they became vegan as ADULTS and are enjoying the health benefits? And why are others citing healthy babies raised on VEGETARIAN food as a rebuttal to this article? What part of this do you not understand?!?! Is the post against teach?  is 1097.

Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant.

Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care. Does the post support education? no I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary. Does the author dislike airline? yes I think that teachers should teach what there assinged to teach. Teachers have gone to school for this and this is what they do for a living. So they probably know what they're talking about. If you dont like what teachers are teaching in public schools then you should probably enroll your kid in a private school Does the author dislike dna testing? no Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy. Does the author dislike noncompete clause employment? yes The NYT is a couple generations late with the headline. For right now, however, what the US needs to to is become selfish and self-centered, in the realpolitik. We have way too many things wrong with this country to cast stones. Jobs, out of control USG eavesdropping, political candidates who eyes show no truth, only $ signs,, etc ad nauseum. Israel and its supporters have been crippling the US for far too long, and they've now found another hook in the form of Iran. Israel has controlled ... yes, controlled! our role in the Middle East for far too long. We need to preserve this country while we still have one. Is the post supportive of kid? yes I would go even further. Making all beaches public, and requiring public access to all beaches WITHOUT the beach-goer having to pay a fee to get to the beach. FOr instance, the NOrthern California coast is spectacular, north of San Francisco. I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden. In my view, we should also prevent people from being able to buy land within a certain distance of the water in areas that remain undeveloped, in order to better preserve these undeveloped areas.

Now and then I have the chance to give advice to the young, and mine always is to dive into marriage and family early. We had 3 kids by the time I graduated from college (on time, at 22). We had two more by 28. True, my wife delayed finishing college; she got her degree in 1975 at age 27 instead of 1970. My other advice to the young: don't decide how to live based on what professors, the magazines, and the newspapers say is the latest thing. It's your life, get cracking on it. Is the author in favor of oversight internet address? yes I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in. Does the post support happy hour? no Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those who send their kids to private or parochial schools. There is no difference. All of these individuals are opting out of the publicly provided education which shapes our society. The purpose of public schools is not only to educate all children, but to create an educated citizenry that will serve our country well, with the shared values of our American society. Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school, or keep them home - are making a choice with their discretionary dollars. Is the post supportive of funding public school? no It can be different elsewhere. The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in the worst aspects of market capitalism. In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life. Hands down. Does the post support overpopulation? yes OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching. However, the solution to the problem is no longer confined to Syria. It has become a global problem now. Islam needs a renaissance! Is the post supportive of lowering tax senior 's cd? yes Wanting to go to a single sex school is no different ultimately than wanting to go to a warm weather school or a school in the mountains or a snowy New England school. It is a landscape with a lot of valid choices. If you've ever visited Wellesley or Smith you will see an amazing learning environment in both locales. That schools struggle and go away is a natural thing: the landscape changes and the choices have increased dramatically. The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly. It is not for everybody but please don't come up with theories to suggest it is not a choice for some: remember we've cultivated a pluralistic society where our wants and needs understandable differ.

I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.

USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice.

That way when you turn 50 your only or youngest child will be 18 and it can be a watershed moment for both of you. I said this to my dentist once as she was saying that she wasn't quite ready to have a baby yet, and I told her that in the early years it doesn't matter in terms of your energy for running around the playground if you are 35 or 40, it's later on when it matters and I felt like after the appt she ran out of the room to run home and get pregnant. But truly, even if you can get pregnant later and have healthy babies, it is brutal dealing with teens when you are going through your own changes. Is the author in favor of human right? no Funny how these things work. Employers pay people as if they're worth nothing, but force them to sign non-compete contracts because they might have the know-how to ruin the company's business. If that isn't worth something, what is? Maybe those small business owners should find better ways to encourage people not to walk off with trade secrets, like treating underlings with respect, paying a living wage, and sharing the profits. Might help. Does the author dislike health? no Justice Ginsberg has the right of free speech also. That's the first thing I thought. Her thoughts on Merrick Garland were very appropriate. The Senate refusing to have a confirmation hearing under the Obama administration is an outrage. More than that, not having Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court is a wasted opportunity for our country. If you are acquainted with the legal system, you can appreciate the years of hard work Judge Garland has put in honing his redoubtable intellect. In addition, he has already provided a lifetime of public service. He richly deserves to be on the Supreme Court. The United States would be a better place. Professor Chemerinsky, you were so insightful during bar review, and you are right on target here. Is the post supportive of worker? yes True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila! Does the post support living wage?  is 1049. This exceeds the model's max length of 1024.
